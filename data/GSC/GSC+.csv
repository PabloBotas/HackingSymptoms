10196695,Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the absence of a maternal contribution to chromosome 15q11-q13. There are four classes of AS according to molecular or cytogenetic status: maternal microdeletion of 15q11-q13 (approximately 70% of AS patients); uniparental disomy (UPD); defects in a putative imprinting centre (IM); the fourth includes 20-30% of AS individuals with biparental inheritance and a normal pattern of allelic methylation in 15q11-q13. Mutations of UBE3A have recently been identified as causing AS in the latter group. Few studies have investigated the phenotypic differences between these classes. We compared 20 non-deletion to 20 age-matched deletion patients and found significant phenotypic differences between the two groups.

10417280,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4-Mb deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis, respectively. At a de novo frequency of approximately.67-1/10,000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints. The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion. Furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process.","['neurobehavioral disorders', 'de novo']","['0000708', '0003745']","[68, 223]","[93, 230]"

10771486,"Schwannomas in the skin are frequently observed in neurofibromatosis 2 patients. In about one-quarter of the cases, skin tumors are the first clinical symptoms of this disease. Recognizing neurofibromatosis-2-related skin tumors is therefore important for early diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2, especially in pediatric patients. In this study, we examined 40 skin tumors (36 schwannomas and four neurofibromas) from 20 neurofibromatosis 2 patients for NF2 mutations and allelic loss. NF2 mutations have been identified in blood from 15 (75%) of the 20 patients. We found NF2 mutations in five (13%) and NF2 allelic loss in 18 (45%) of the 40 analyzed tumors. Genetic alterations (allelic loss or mutation) were thus found in 50 (63%) out of the total of 80 examined alleles. In 17 (43%) tumors, alterations were found on both NF2 alleles.

Retrospective noncomparative case series.

Of 105 consecutive patients with eyelid basal cell carcinoma managed at an Ocular Oncology Center between January 1973 and December 1999, four patients with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were identified.

The ophthalmic and systemic features, management, and outcome of patients with eyelid basal cell carcinoma associated with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome were analyzed. The published literature on Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, specifically related to genetics, systemic features, ophthalmic associations, and prophylactic management strategies, was reviewed.

Response of the eyelid basal cell carcinoma to treatment and the final systemic condition were the main outcome measures.

All four patients had a family history of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome. The systemic manifestations included multiple basal cell carcinomas in all the patients, frontal bossing or increased occipitofrontal circumference in three patients, palmar pits in two patients, odontogenic keratocyst in one patient, ectopic calcification in one patient, and bifid rib in one patient. The mean age at the detection of the first basal cell carcinoma was 30 years (range, 16-38 years). All four patients had multiple basal cell carcinomas on the face and elsewhere. The eyelid basal cell carcinoma was advanced with orbital infiltration in three patients, one of whom opted for palliative radiotherapy, whereas the other two underwent orbital exenteration. The fourth patient, who had localized recurrent basal cell carcinoma in the upper eyelid, was treated with excision and eyelid reconstruction. At the final follow-up (mean, 41 months), eyelid basal cell carcinoma was cured in three patients and stable in one patient. No patient had life-threatening sequelae of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.

Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome that may be associated with eyelid basal cell carcinoma. The associated systemic findings may be a clue to the diagnosis of this condition.

These rearrangements involve deletions found in approximately 70% of Prader-Willi or Angelman's syndrome patients (PWS, AS), duplications detected in some cases of autism, triplications and inverted duplications. HERC2-containing (HEct domain and RCc1 domain protein 2) segmental duplications or duplicons are present at two of these breakpoints (BP2 and BP3) mainly associated with deletions. We show here that clusters containing several copies of the human chromosome 15 low-copy repeat (LCR15) duplicon are located at each of the six described 15q11-q14 BPs. In addition, our results suggest the existence of breakpoints for large 15q11-q13 deletions in a proximal duplicon-containing clone.

12011146,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) must be suspected in patients presenting with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma at a young age who are therefore at theoretical risk of developing bilateral disease. We identified 45 patients aged 30 years or less at the onset of symptoms of a unilateral vestibular schwannoma. Molecular genetic analysis of the NF2 gene was completed on peripheral blood samples in all 45 and on 28 tumour samples. No pathogenic NF2 mutations were identified in any of the blood samples. NF2 point mutations were identified in 21/28 (75%) tumour samples and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 21/28 (75%) tumour samples. Both mutational hits were identified in 18/28 (65%) tumour samples. In one multilobular tumour, one (presumably first hit) mutation was confirmed which was common to different foci of the tumour, while the second mutational event differed between foci. The molecular findings in this patient were consistent with somatic mosaicism for NF2 and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed with the presence of two meningiomas on a follow up MRI scan. A further patient developed a contralateral vestibular schwannoma on a follow up MRI scan in whom neither of the truncating mutations in the vestibular schwannoma were present in blood. It is important when counselling patients with unilateral vestibular schwannomas to identify (1) those at risk of bilateral disease, (2) those at risk of developing other tumours, and (3) other family members at risk of developing NF2. Comparing tumour and blood DNA cannot exclude mosaicism in the index case and cannot, therefore, be used to predict those at risk of developing further tumours. However, identification of both mutations or one mutation plus LOH in the tumour and exclusion of those mutations in the blood samples of the sibs or offspring of the affected case may be sufficient to render further screening unnecessary in these relatives.","['Neurofibromatosis', 'unilateral vestibular schwannoma', 'vestibular schwannoma', 'schwannoma', 'young', 'young age', 'bilateral disease', 'unilateral vestibular schwannoma', 'vestibular schwannoma', 'schwannoma', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'somatic mosaicism', 'meningiomas', 'contralateral vestibular schwannoma', 'vestibular schwannoma', 'schwannoma', 'vestibular schwannoma', 'schwannoma', 'unilateral vestibular schwannomas', 'vestibular schwannomas', 'schwannomas', 'bilateral disease', 'tumours', 'tumour', 'tumours', 'tumour']","['0006746', '0009590', '0009588', '0100008', '0003593', '0003593', '0009589', '0009590', '0009588', '0100008', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0001442', '0002858', '0009589', '0009588', '0100008', '0009588', '0100008', '0009590', '0009588', '0100008', '0009589', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664']","[0, 79, 90, 101, 117, 117, 179, 276, 287, 298, 415, 555, 618, 686, 722, 822, 947, 1039, 1106, 1120, 1131, 1217, 1228, 1309, 1320, 1331, 1376, 1433, 1508, 1650, 1733]","[17, 111, 111, 111, 122, 126, 196, 308, 308, 308, 421, 561, 624, 692, 728, 828, 964, 1050, 1141, 1141, 1141, 1238, 1238, 1342, 1342, 1342, 1393, 1440, 1514, 1657, 1739]"

Age at diagnosis, intracranial meningiomas, and type of treatment center were informative predictors of the risk of mortality. In Cox models, the relative risk of mortality increased 1.13-fold per year decrease in age at diagnosis (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.18) and was 2.51-fold greater in people with meningiomas compared with those without meningiomas (95% CI 1.38-4.57).

In a separate model, the relative risk of mortality in people with constitutional NF2 missense mutations was very low compared with those with other types of mutations (nonsense or frameshift mutations, splice-site mutations, and large deletions), but the CI could not be well quantified because there was only one death among people with missense mutations. We conclude that age at diagnosis, the strongest single predictor of the risk of mortality, is a useful index for patient counseling and clinical management (as are intracranial meningiomas).

Examination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) has shown that the affected individuals in both families share SNPs within IHH consistent with that of a common founder.

We present clinical and radiographic data from three unrelated families in which 12 members share the same heterozygous CDMP-1 mutation, an insertion (insG206), resulting in a frameshift predicted to cause functional haploinsufficiency. Although eight mutation carriers display BDC, four have normal hands and feet, confirming nonpenetrance of BDC with CDMP-1 mutations. In addition, several carriers have other skeletal abnormalities, including severe bilateral vertical talus (in two), developmental hip dysplasia (in one), and short stature (in two, who are otherwise unaffected). Premature vertebral end-plate disease was observed in four mutation carriers and was associated with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in three of these. Axial skeletal involvement has not been previously reported in association with CDMP-1 mutations. This finding is consistent with CDMP-1 expression in human hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are present in the ring epiphyses of vertebral end plates. Phenotypic variation in BDC has previously been attributed either to locus heterogeneity or to the varied functional effects of different CDMP-1 mutations. The remarkable range of phenotypes caused by this identical CDMP-1 mutation in these families emphasizes the crucial role of genetic background, stochastic variation and/or environmental factors in modifying the observed phenotype.

Apparently, most patients are sporadic cases. The genetic mechanism underlying familial AS has remained enigmatic for a long time. Recently, evidence has been emerging suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance of a detectable or undetectable defect in a gene or genes at 15q11-13, subject to genomic imprinting. The present report describes an unusually large pedigree with segregation of AS through maternal inheritance and apparent asymptomatic transmission through several male ancestors.

1496981,"The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene has been hypothesized to be a recessive tumor suppressor, with mutations at the same locus on chromosome 22 that lead to NF2 also leading to sporadic tumors of the types seen in NF2. Flanking markers for this gene have previously been defined as D22S1 centromeric and D22S28 telomeric. Identification of subregions of this interval that are consistently rearranged in the NF2-related tumors would aid in better defining the disease locus. To this end, we have compared tumor and constitutional DNAs, isolated from 39 unrelated patients with sporadic and NF2-associated acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas, at eight polymorphic loci on chromosome 22. Two of the tumors studied revealed loss-of-heterozygosity patterns, which is consistent with the presence of chromosome 22 terminal deletions. By using additional polymorphic markers, the terminal deletion breakpoint found in one of the tumors, an acoustic neuroma from an NF2 patient, was mapped within the previously defined NF2 region. The breakpoint occurred between the haplotyped markers D22S41/D22S46 and D22S56. This finding redefines the proximal flanking marker and localizes the NF2 gene between markers D22S41/D22S46 and D22S28. In addition, we identified a sporadic acoustic neuroma that reveals a loss-of-heterozygosity pattern consistent with mitotic recombination or deletion and reduplication, which are mechanisms not previously seen in studies of these tumors. This finding, while inconsistent with models of tumorigenesis that invoke single deletions and their gene-dosage effects, lends further support to the recessive tumor-suppressor model.","['neurofibromatosis', 'tumor', 'sporadic', 'tumors', 'tumors', 'tumor', 'sporadic', 'acoustic neuromas', 'meningiomas', 'schwannomas', 'ependymomas', 'tumors', 'tumors', 'acoustic neuroma', 'sporadic', 'acoustic neuroma', 'tumors', 'tumor']","['0006746', '0002664', '0003745', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0003745', '0009588', '0002858', '0100008', '0002888', '0002664', '0002664', '0009588', '0003745', '0009588', '0002664', '0002664']","[4, 80, 181, 190, 424, 509, 581, 609, 628, 641, 658, 726, 952, 963, 1285, 1294, 1487, 1656]","[21, 85, 189, 196, 430, 514, 589, 626, 639, 652, 669, 732, 958, 979, 1293, 1310, 1493, 1661]"

The presence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas is sufficient for the diagnosis. Skin manifestations are less common than in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1; von Recklinghausen disease). The apparent clinical distinction between NF1 and NF2 has been confirmed at the level of the gene locus by linkage studies; the gene for NF1 maps to chromosome 17, whereas the gene for NF2 has been assigned (in a single family) to chromosome 22. To increase the precision of the genetic mapping of NF2 and to determine whether additional susceptibility loci exist, we have performed linkage analysis on 12 families with NF2 by using four polymorphic markers from chromosome 22 and a marker at the NF1 locus on chromosome 17. Our results confirm the assignment of the gene for NF2 to chromosome 22 and do not support the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity. We believe that chromosome 22 markers can now be used for presymptomatic diagnosis in selected families. The NF2 gene is tightly linked to the D22S32 locus (maximum lod score 4.12; recombination fraction 0). A CA-repeat polymorphism at the CRYB2 locus was the most informative marker in our families (lod score 5.99), but because the observed recombination fraction between NF2 and CRYB2 was 10 cM, predictions using this marker will need to be interpreted with caution.","['Neurofibromatosis', 'autosomal dominant', 'dominant', 'vestibular schwannomas', 'schwannomas', 'other tumors', 'tumors', 'tumors of the nervous system', 'cranial and spinal meningiomas', 'spinal meningiomas', 'meningiomas', 'schwannomas', 'ependymomas', 'bilateral vestibular schwannomas', 'vestibular schwannomas', 'schwannomas', 'Skin manifestations', 'neurofibromatosis', 'genetic heterogeneity', 'heterogeneity']","['0006746', '0000006', '0000006', '0009588', '0100008', '0003008', '0002664', '0004375', '0100009', '0100010', '0002858', '0100008', '0002888', '0009589', '0009588', '0100008', '0000951', '0006746', '0001425', '0001425']","[0, 37, 47, 101, 112, 128, 134, 134, 174, 186, 193, 206, 223, 252, 262, 273, 318, 362, 1056, 1064]","[17, 55, 55, 123, 123, 140, 140, 162, 204, 204, 204, 217, 234, 284, 284, 284, 337, 379, 1077, 1077]"

The presence of a faint maternal band detected by methylation-specific PCR analysis of the SNURF-SNRPN locus in approximately one-third of patients who have an ID but no imprinting center deletion suggested that these patients are mosaics of ID cells and normal cells. In two patients studied, somatic mosaicism was proven by molecular and cellular cloning, respectively. X inactivation studies of cloned fibroblasts from one patient suggest that ID occurred before the blastocyst stage. To quantify the degree of mosaicism, we developed a novel quantitative methylation assay based on real-time PCR. In 24 patients tested, the percentage of normal cells ranged from <1% to 40%. Regression analysis suggests that patients with a higher percentage of normally methylated cells tend to have milder clinical symptoms than patients with a lower percentage.

Nineteen patients with AS determined by deletion of chromosome 15q11-13.

Epilepsy severity, epilepsy evolution, and response to antiepileptic drug treatment.

All patients with AS in this group had generalized epilepsy, and 10 (53%) also had partial epilepsy. Main seizure types were atypical absences and myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Mean age at onset was 1 year 1 month. Epilepsy aggravated by fever occurred in 10 patients (53%) and status epilepticus in 16 (84%). Eighteen patients (95%) had previous or current history of daily seizures, of which 14 (64%) had disabling seizures. Multiple seizure types were observed in 13 patients (53%). History of refractory epilepsy was reported in 16 patients (84%). Parents reported improvement, characterized by decrease in seizure frequency or seizure control, at the mean age of 5.3 years. Therefore, most of these patients had a period of refractory epilepsy; however, improvement occurred during late childhood and puberty. The best therapeutic response was obtained with valproic acid alone or in association with phenobarbital or clonazepam. Epilepsy was aggravated by carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and vigabatrin.

Patients with AS with deletion have epilepsy with early onset and stereotyped electroclinical profile regarding seizure type, severity, and response to antiepileptic drug treatment.

One novel mutation, a G-->A transition (2157G-->A) in exon 15 of the PTCH2 gene, was identified in this family with NBCCS by direct sequencing and digestion with the AvaI restriction enzyme. The mutation was not found in normal family members or in 520 controls. The mutation led to an R719Q amino acid substitution in an extracellular loop of the PTCH2 protein. Functional studies revealed that the R719Q mutation resulted in inactivation of PTCH2 inhibitory activities. In contrast to wild type PTCH2, PTCH2-R719Q could not inhibit cell proliferation.

PTCH2 (2157G-->A), a novel missense mutation, underlies NBCCS, resulting in the loss of PTCH2 inhibitory function in the Shh signalling pathway.","['basal cell carcinoma', 'autosomal dominant', 'dominant']","['0002671', '0000006', '0000006']","[8, 64, 74]","[28, 82, 82]"

Four additional BOFS patients were found to have de novo missense mutations in the highly conserved exons 4 and 5 (basic region of the DNA binding domain) of the TFAP2A gene in the candidate deleted region.

18701717,"Angelman syndrome is a neurological disorder whose symptoms include severe mental retardation, loss of motor coordination, and sleep disturbances. The disease is caused by a loss of function of UBE3A, which encodes a HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase. Here, we generate a Drosophila model for the disease. The results of several experiments show that the functions of human UBE3A and its fly counterpart, dube3a, are similar. First, expression of Dube3a is enriched in the Drosophila nervous system, including mushroom bodies, the seat of learning and memory. Second, we have generated dube3a null mutants, and they appear normal externally, but display abnormal locomotive behavior and circadian rhythms, and defective long-term memory. Third, flies that overexpress Dube3a in the nervous system also display locomotion defects, dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, missense mutations in UBE3A alleles of Angelman syndrome patients alter amino acid residues conserved in the fly protein, and when introduced into dube3a, behave as loss-of-function mutations. The simplest model for Angelman syndrome is that in the absence of UBE3A, particular substrates fail to be ubiquitinated and proteasomally degraded, accumulate in the brain, and interfere with brain function. We have generated flies useful for genetic screens to identify Dube3a substrates. These flies overexpress Dube3a in the eye or wing and display morphological abnormalities, dependent on the critical catalytic cysteine. We conclude that dube3a mutants are a valid model for Angelman syndrome, with great potential for identifying the elusive UBE3A substrates relevant to the disease.","['neurological disorder', 'severe mental retardation', 'mental retardation', 'retardation', 'loss of motor coordination', 'sleep disturbances']","['0000707', '0002187', '0001249', '0001249', '0002275', '0002360']","[23, 68, 75, 82, 95, 127]","[44, 93, 93, 93, 121, 145]"

Using high-resolution banding technique, we detected a microdeletion in the proximal region of chromosome 15q in four cases. The deleted segment was heterogenous between these patients, and the common deleted region appeared to be 15q11.2. Four patients with deleted 15q were all sporadic cases, whereas in the sib cases we could not detect a visible deletion in the long arm of chromosome 15. However, there was no clinical difference between sporadic cases and sib cases. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographic bands of Southern hybridization using two DNA segments, pML34 and pTD3-21, as probes demonstrated that two patients had only one copy for each of the probes. In the remaining four patients, including the sibs, two copies of each sequence were retained. The probes used here detect a molecular deletion in most Prader-Willi syndrome patients.

3092103,"The application of recombinant DNA techniques has identified two fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis in man. The first involves a qualitative or quantitative change in an oncogene (see ref. 1 for review). In the second, discovered in embryonal tumours, a primary mutation occurs which is recessive at the cellular level to the normal allele. The growth of a tumour ensues only after a secondary change, such as chromosome loss or mitotic recombination, eliminates the normal allele, thereby unmasking the altered allele. Because its effect is recessive, the primary mutation may also occur and be transmitted in the germ line, resulting in a familial pattern for the disease. In familial cases, independent bilateral tumours are common, since the tumours result from a single event--loss of the normal genes--which can occur in any cell. This contrasts with non-familial (sporadic) cases where solitary tumours result from the infrequent occurrence of two rare events within the same cell. By a molecular genetic approach we have now shown that acoustic neuroma, one of the most common tumours of the human nervous system, is specifically associated with loss of genes on human chromosome 22 and may result from the mechanism of tumorigenesis discovered in embryonal tumours. This finding might provide a clue to the chromosomal location of the defective gene in bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, an autosomal dominant disorder with the hallmark of bilateral acoustic neuromas. In view of the frequent occurrence of meningiomas in patients with bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis and the association of meningioma with loss of chromosome 22 previously reported in cytogenetic studies, we suggest that a common event underlies tumorigenesis in acoustic neuroma and meningioma.","['tumours', 'tumours', 'tumours', 'sporadic', 'tumours', 'acoustic neuroma', 'tumours of the human nervous system', 'tumours', 'tumours', 'bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis', 'neurofibromatosis', 'autosomal dominant disorder', 'autosomal dominant', 'dominant', 'bilateral acoustic neuromas', 'acoustic neuromas', 'meningiomas', 'bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis', 'neurofibromatosis', 'meningioma', 'acoustic neuroma', 'meningioma']","['0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0003745', '0002664', '0009588', '0004375', '0002664', '0002664', '0009589', '0006746', '0000006', '0000006', '0000006', '0009589', '0009588', '0002858', '0009589', '0006746', '0002858', '0009588', '0002858']","[248, 721, 751, 876, 907, 1049, 1090, 1090, 1271, 1367, 1386, 1408, 1408, 1418, 1457, 1467, 1524, 1553, 1572, 1613, 1753, 1774]","[255, 728, 758, 884, 914, 1065, 1125, 1097, 1278, 1403, 1403, 1435, 1426, 1426, 1484, 1484, 1535, 1589, 1589, 1623, 1769, 1784]"

We studied 15 affected male and 8 affected female members of one large kindred with neurofibromatosis 2. None of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 1. Between the ages of 15 and 53 years, the patients had multiple central nervous system tumors of various types--mainly, bilateral acoustic neuromas. Two or more tumors eventually developed in 20 of the patients; 9 had evidence of only bilateral acoustic neuromas. Meningiomas and ependymomas were more common among the young patients; those who initially presented with acoustic neuromas were nearly a decade older. Intracranial nontumoral calcifications were present in most patients and were also found in symptom-free children. The presence of such lesions is probably a prodromic feature of neurofibromatosis 2.

Ten of the small and medium size acoustic neurinomas had no brain stem and cerebellar symptoms or signs at all, only the 8th cranial nerve was affected. All large tumors already had brain stem symptoms and one-third of them also had cerebellar symptoms, lesions of further cranial nerves and increasing intracranial pressure. All these findings were always present in giant tumors. Neurootological functional laboratory examinations cannot be replaced by CT because of the possibility of false negative findings in the smallest acoustic neurinomas.

Prolonged runs of rhythmic 2-3/s activity (200-500 microV) often more prominent anteriorly, sometimes associated with discharges (ill-defined spike/wave complexes). 3.

3547011,"The nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by major manifestations, such as multiple basal-cell carcinomata, cysts of the jaws, and skeletal--specifically, rib--abnormalities. Findings in 53 patients and a review of the literature document both major and lesser-known manifestations of the disorder. The odontogenic keratocyst, which usually appears during adolescence, has a marked tendency to recur. In addition to the skin tumors, milia, epidermoid cysts, chalazia, comedones, and palmar and plantar pits are frequent. The skin tumors, originally thought to be independent of sun exposure, are more common in sun-exposed areas and are far less frequent and occur at a much later age in blacks than in whites. There is some evidence that radiation of the skin promotes the appearance of skin cancers in this disorder. Unilateral linear nevoid basal-cell carcinomas with comedones may represent postzygotic somatic mutation. A proclivity to other forms of neoplasia exists. Patients with this syndrome have had medulloblastoma, meningioma, ovarian fibroma, ovarian fibrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma of the jaws, cardiac fibroma, fetal rhabdomyoma, and lymphatic or chylous cysts of the mesentery. In addition to the usual modalities of treatment, topical immunotherapy and topical 5-fluorouracil have been used with success. Oral synthetic retinoids, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid, have been used to prevent new lesions from appearing and to arrest the growth of older lesions by inducing differentiation. The independent observations of increased prostaglandin levels associated both with odontogenic keratocyst expansion and aggression of basal cell cancers merit further investigation both as a fundamental cellular mechanism and as a possible basis for treatment (e.g., with antiprostaglandins). The key to pre- and early postnatal diagnosis of the disorder--as well as to an understanding of the basic abnormality--lies in molecular genetics.

Contractures at other major joints are variable. There are no associated visceral anomalies; intelligence is normal. There can be marked intrafamilial and interfamilial variability. Twenty-two propositi with similar distal contractures had additional findings and were classified into five subcategories of distal arthrogryposis (type IIA-E). Among type II patients cleft palate, cleft lip, small tongue, trismus, ptosis, epicanthal folds, keratoconus, short stature, scoliosis, a unique hand position, and dull normal intelligence were seen.

The examination included a complete neuro-ophthalmic assessment, physical examination, and, for patients and first-degree relatives at risk, cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement, if not previously performed.

The most common ocular abnormalities were posterior subcapsular or capsular, cortical, or mixed lens opacities in 33 (67%) of 49 patients with neurofibromatosis 2 and retinal hamartomas in 11 (22%). We used segregation analysis to determine the mutation carrier status of six at-risk offspring who were 30 years old or younger in two multigeneration families. Three asymptomatic mutation carriers had cataracts, whereas those who were predicted not to carry the mutation did not have cataracts. Asymptomatic mutation carriers may have developmental abnormalities of the eye that are detectable in childhood or adolescence, a finding that may assist in early diagnosis of the disease.

A variety of ocular abnormalities are present in neurofibromatosis 2, including cataracts, retinal hamartomas, and ocular motor deficits. Many of these are developmental or acquired early in life and may assist in presymptomatic diagnosis.

Work-up included skin and neurologic examinations, audiometry, a complete ophthalmology examination with slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the lens and fundus, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and, in some, of the spine. Mean age-at-onset in 58 individuals was 20.3 years; initial symptoms resulted from vestibular schwannomas (44.4%), other CNS tumors (22.2%), skin tumors (12.7%), and ocular manifestations including cataracts and retinal hamartomas (12.7%). Five asymptomatic individuals were diagnosed through screening. Vestibular schwannomas were documented in 62 individuals (98.4%); other findings included cataracts (81.0%), skin tumors (67.7%), spinal tumors (67.4%), and meningiomas (49.2%). Usually, clinical manifestations and course were similar within families but differed among families. To assess possible heterogeneity, we assigned affected individuals to three proposed subtypes (representing mild, intermediate, and severe NF2) based on age-at-onset, presence or absence of CNS tumors other than vestibular schwannomas, and presence or absence of retinal hamartomas.

Among 53 sporadic cases, 37 (70%) had molecular deletion, which commonly extended from D15S9 to D15S12, although not all deletions were identical. Of 8 familial cases, 3 sibs from one family had a molecular deletion involving only 2 loci, D15S10 and GABRB3, which define the critical region for AS phenotypes. The parental origin of deletion, both in sporadic and familial cases, was exclusively maternal and consistent with a genomic imprinting hypothesis. Among sporadic and familial cases without deletion, no uniparental disomy was found and most of them were shown to inherit chromosomes 15 from both parents (biparental inheritance). A discrepancy between cytogenetic and molecular deletion was observed in 14 (26%) of 53 patients in whom cytogenetic analysis could be performed.

7905534,"Angelman syndrome (AS) results from a lack of maternal contribution from chromosome 15q11-13, arising from de novo deletion in most cases or rarely from uniparental disomy. These families are associated with a low recurrence risk. However, in a minority of families, more than one child is affected. No deletion has been found in these families, except one. The mode of inheritance in these families is autosomal dominant modified by imprinting. Sporadic cases, with no observable deletion, therefore pose a counselling dilemma as there could be a recurrence risk as high as 50%. We present a series of 93 AS patients, showing the relative contribution of these different genetic mechanisms. Eighty-one AS patients were sporadic cases while 12 cases came from six families. Sixty cases had deletions in 15q11-13 detected by a set of highly polymorphic (CA)n repeats markers and conventional RFLPs. Ten sporadic cases plus all 12 familial cases had no detectable deletion. In addition, two cases of de novo deletions occurred in a chromosome 15 carrying a pericentric inversion. In one of these the AS child had a cousin with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) arising from a de novo deletion in an inv(15) inherited from his father. One case arose from a maternal balanced t(9;15)(p24;q15) translocation. There were three cases of uniparental disomy. Five patients were monoallelic for all loci across the minimal AS critical region, but the presence of a deletion cannot be confirmed. In familial cases, all affected sibs inherited the same maternal chromosome 15 markers for the region 15q11-13. Two cases were observed with a de novo deletion starting close to the locus D15S11 (IR4-2R), providing evidence for the development of classical AS with smaller deletions. Cytogenetic analysis proved limited in its ability to detect deletions, detecting only 42 out of 60 cases. However, cytogenetic analysis is still essential to detect chromosomal abnormalities other than deletions such as inversions and balanced translocations since both have an increased risk for deletions.

We have analyzed two sibling pairs with AS and a larger family with four AS offspring of three sisters with several recently described microsatellite polymorphisms in the AS region. AS siblings inherited the same maternal alleles at the GABRB3 and GABRA5 loci, and the unaffected siblings of AS individuals inherited the other maternal alleles at these loci. In one of the AS sibling pairs, analysis of a recombination event indicates that the mutation responsible for AS is distal to locus D15S63. This result is consistent with a previously described imprinted submicroscopic deletion causing AS, a deletion that includes loci D15S10, D15S113, and GABRB3, all distal to D15S63. The analysis of the larger AS family provides the first clear demonstration of a new mutation in nondeletion AS. Analysis of linkage of AS to GABRB3 in these three families, on the assumption of imprinted inheritance (i.e., penetrance of an AS mutation is 1 if transmitted maternally and is 0 if transmitted paternally), indicates a maximum lod score of 3.52 at theta = 0.","['phenotypic abnormality', 'dominant', 'mode of inheritance']","['0000118', '0000006', '0000005']","[139, 260, 327]","[161, 268, 346]"

Sixty-seven individuals (56.2%) from 41 of these kindreds revealed 36 different putative disease-causing mutations.

8755929,"Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas, ovarian fibromas, and a variety of developmental defects. All affected individuals share certain key features, but there is significant phenotypic variability within and among kindreds with respect to malformations. The gene (NBCCS) maps to chromosome 9q22, and allelic loss at this location is common in tumors from Gorlin syndrome patients. Two recessive cancer-predisposition syndromes, xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPAC) and Fanconi anemia group C (FACC), map to the NBCCS region; and unusual, dominant mutations in these genes have been proposed as the cause of Gorlin syndrome. This study presents cytogenetic and molecular characterization of germ-line deletions in one patient with a chromosome 9q22 deletion and in a second patient with a deletion of 9q22-q3l. Both have typical features of Gorlin syndrome plus additional findings, including mental retardation, conductive hearing loss, and failure to thrive. That Gorlin syndrome can be caused by null mutations (deletions) rather than by activating mutations has several implications. First, in conjunction with previous analyses of allelic loss in tumors, this study provides evidence that associated neoplasms arise with homozygous inactivation of the gene. In addition, dominant mutations of the XPAC and FACC1 genes can be ruled out as the cause of Gorlin syndrome, since the two patients described have null mutations. Finally, phenotypic features that show variable expression must be influenced by genetic background, epigenetic effects, somatic mutations, or environmental factors, since these two patients with identical alterations (deletions) of the Gorlin syndrome gene have somewhat different manifestations of Gorlin syndrome.","['autosomal dominant', 'autosomal dominant disorder', 'basal cell carcinomas', 'medulloblastomas', 'ovarian fibromas', 'developmental defects', 'significant phenotypic variability within and among kindreds', 'phenotypic variability', 'variability', 'tumors', 'cancer', 'mental retardation', 'retardation', 'conductive hearing loss', 'hearing loss', 'failure to thrive', 'tumors', 'neoplasms', 'variable', 'variable expression']","['0000006', '0000006', '0002671', '0002885', '0010618', '0001263', '0003822', '0003812', '0003812', '0002664', '0002664', '0001249', '0001249', '0000405', '0000365', '0001508', '0002664', '0002664', '0003813', '0003828']","[22, 22, 76, 99, 117, 152, 241, 253, 264, 422, 474, 971, 978, 991, 1002, 1020, 1230, 1283, 1544, 1544]","[40, 49, 97, 115, 133, 173, 301, 275, 275, 428, 480, 989, 989, 1014, 1014, 1037, 1236, 1292, 1552, 1563]"

We identified 28 mutations that are distributed throughout the entire gene, and most (86%) cause protein truncation. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate that failure of one NBCCS family to show clear linkage to chromosome 9q22.3-31 is most likely due to germinal mosaicism. We have identified three families bearing identical mutations with variable phenotypes, suggesting phenotypic variability in NBCCS is a complex genetic event. No phenotype genotype correlation between the position of truncation mutations and major clinical features was evident. Two missense mutations have been identified, and their location within transmembrane domains supports the notion that PTCH may have a transport function. The preponderance of truncation mutants in the germ line of NBCCS patients suggests that the developmental defects associated with the disorder are most likely due to haploinsufficiency.","['basal cell carcinoma', 'sporadic', 'basal cell carcinomas', 'phenotypic variability', 'variability', 'variable phenotypes', 'variable', 'phenotypic variability', 'variability', 'developmental defects']","['0002671', '0003745', '0002671', '0003812', '0003812', '0003813', '0003813', '0003812', '0003812', '0001263']","[111, 171, 180, 227, 238, 759, 759, 791, 802, 1218]","[131, 179, 201, 249, 249, 778, 767, 813, 813, 1239]"
8988171,"Angelman syndrome (AS), characterized by mental retardation, seizures, frequent smiling and laughter, and abnormal gait, is one of the best examples of human disease in which genetic imprinting plays a role. In about 70% of cases, AS is caused by de novo maternal deletions at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Approximately 2% of AS cases are caused by paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 (ref. 3) and 2-3% are caused by ""imprinting mutations'. In the remaining 25% of AS cases, no deletion, uniparental disomy (UPD), or methylation abnormality is detectable, and these cases, unlike deletions or UPD, can be familial. These cases are likely to result from mutations in a gene that is expressed either exclusively or preferentially from the maternal chromosome 15. We have found that a 15q inversion inherited by an AS child from her normal mother disrupts the 5' end of the UBE3A (E6-AP) gene, the product of which functions in protein ubiquitination. We have looked for novel UBE3A mutations in nondeletion/non-UPD/non-imprinting mutation (NDUI) AS patients and have found one patient who is heterozygous for a 5-bp de novo tandem duplication. We have also found in two brothers a heterozygous mutation, an A to G transition that creates a new 3' splice junction 7 bp upstream from the normal splice junction.

9096762,"We present an 8-year-old African-American boy with medulloblastoma and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) who exhibited the radiosensitive response of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) formation in the area irradiated for medulloblastoma. Such a response is well-documented in Caucasian NBCCS patients with medulloblastoma. The propositus was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 2 years and underwent surgery, chemotherapy, and craniospinal irradiation. At the age of 6 years, he was diagnosed with NBCCS following his presentation with a large odontogenic keratocyst of the mandible, pits of the palms and soles and numerous BCCs in the area of the back and neck that had been irradiated previously for medulloblastoma. Examination of other relatives showed that the propositus' mother also had NBCCS but was more mildly affected; in particular, she had no BCCs. This case illustrates complex gene-environment interaction, in that increased skin pigmentation in African-Americans is presumably protective against ultraviolet, but not ionizing, radiation. This case and other similar cases in the literature show the importance of considering NBCCS in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a medulloblastoma, especially before the age of 5 years, and of examining other close relatives for signs of NBCCS to determine the patient's at-risk status.

The selection criteria included severe intellectual disability, ataxic or hypermotoric limb movements, lack of speech, a ""happy"" demeanour, epilepsy, and facial appearance consistent with the diagnosis. Patients were examined, medical records perused, and patients' doctors contacted as required. Genetic tests performed included routine cytogenetics, DNA methylation analysis (with probe PW71B), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (with probes D15S10, GABRbeta3, or SNRPN). A deletion in the AS region was detected in 11 patients (9 males and 2 females) of 22 tested. The mean age at last review (March 1996) was 31.5 years (range 24 to 36 years). Clinical assessment documented findings of large mouth and jaw with deep set eyes, and microcephaly in nine patients (two having a large head size for height). No patient was hypopigmented; 1/11 patients was fair. Outbursts of laughter occurred in all patients but infrequently in 7/11 (64%) and a constant happy demeanour was present in 5/11 (46%). All had epilepsy, with improvement in 5/11 (46%), no change in 4 (36%), and deterioration in 2 (18%). The EEG was abnormal in 10/10 patients.

Lesions were identified by clinical appearance, photographed, and confirmed histologically.

To determine the frequency of skin lesions in patients with MEN1.

Multiple facial angiofibromas were observed in 28 (88%) of the patients with MEN1, with 16 patients (50%) having 5 or more. Angiofibromas were clinically and histologically identical to those in individuals with tuberous sclerosis. Collagenomas were observed in 23 patients (72%).

Cytogenetic findings suggested that the gene mutated in TBS maps to chromosome 16q12.1, where SALL1 (previously known as HSAL1), a human homologue of spalt (sal), is located. SAL is a developmental regulator in Drosophila melanogaster and is conserved throughout evolution. No phenotype has yet been attributed to mutations in vertebrate sal-like genes. The expression patterns of sal-like genes in mouse, Xenopus and the fish Medaka, and the finding that Medaka sal is regulated by Sonic hedgehog (Shh; ref. 11), prompted us to examine SALL1 as a TBS candidate gene. Here we demonstrate that SALL1 mutations cause TBS in a family with vertical transmission of TBS and in an unrelated family with a sporadic case of TBS. Both mutations are predicted to result in a prematurely terminated SALL1 protein lacking all putative DNA binding domains. TBS therefore represents another human developmental disorder caused by mutations in a putative C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor.","['autosomal-dominant', 'dominant', 'anal, renal, limb and ear anomalies', 'ear anomalies', 'sporadic']","['0000006', '0000006', '0004378', '0000598', '0003745']","[53, 63, 116, 138, 852]","[71, 71, 151, 151, 860]"

9556704,"Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are 2 clinically distinct disorders associated with multiple anomalies and mental retardation. They are only discussed together because they share a similar and uncommon genetic basis: they involve genes that are located in the same region in the genome and are characterized by genetic imprinting. This normal process has contributed to these 2 complex and severe conditions through inactivation of 1 copy of the genes relevant to each disorder: the maternally derived copy of genes for Prader-Willi syndrome in proximal 15q are normally silent, and a paternally derived copy of 1 gene for Angelman syndrome in 15q is normally silent. For both disorders, when the normally active copy of the gene or genes is missing, abnormality results. Since the genes for these 2 disorders are located very close together, and since the center involved in inactivating the genes involved in imprinting may be the same, both these disorders usually result from the same chromosomal deletion; which disorder results depends on the parent of origin of the chromosome 15 that becomes deleted. Both Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome can also occur as a result of having both members of the chromosome 15 pair derived from 1 parent, a condition known as uniparental disomy. Both can also result from a structural abnormality of the imprinting center, known as an imprinting mutation. In addition, Angelman syndrome can be caused by a mutation in the gene that causes it; a comparable cause is not present in Prader-Willi syndrome since it results from abnormality in more than 1 gene. Finally, despite the complexity of possible causes, all but the single gene mutation of the Angelman syndrome gene can be detected through methylation-sensitive DNA probes, since DNA methylation is the process by which the genes for these 2 disorders are imprinted. This unusual property of specific areas of the DNA holds promise for future treatment of these and other disorders related to imprinting through reversal of the imprinting process.","['mental retardation', 'retardation']","['0001249', '0001249']","[111, 118]","[129, 129]"
9557895,"The causal heterogeneity of Angelman syndrome (AS) makes providing information regarding recurrence risk both important and challenging, and may have a dramatic impact on reproductive decision-making for the nuclear and extended family. Most cases of AS result from typical large de novo deletions of 15q11-q13, and are expected to have a low (<1%) risk of recurrence. AS due to paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), which occurs in the absence of a parental translocation, is likewise expected to have a <1% risk of recurrence. Parental transmission of a structurally or functionally unbalanced chromosome complement can lead to 15q11-q13 deletions or to UPD and will result in case-specific recurrence risks. In instances where there is no identifiable large deletion or UPD, the risk for recurrence may be as high as 50% as the result of either a maternally inherited imprinting center (IC) mutation or a ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) gene mutation. Individuals with AS who have none of the above abnormalities comprise a significant proportion of cases, and some may be at a 50% recurrence risk. Misdiagnoses, as well, can be represented in this group. In light of the many conditions which are clinically similar to AS, it is essential to address the possibility of diagnostic uncertainty and potential misdiagnosis prior to the provision of genetic counseling.

A further 17 families fulfilling modified criteria for NF2 have also been analysed. Causative mutations have been identified in 54 (43%) classical families and six (35%) of those fulfilling modified criteria. Forty-two cases from 38 families with truncating mutations had an average age at onset of symptoms of 19 years and diagnosis at 22.4 years. Fifty-one cases from 16 families with splice site mutations (15 from six), missense mutations (18 from six), and large deletions (18 from five) had an average age of onset of 27.8 years and at diagnosis of 33.4 years. Subjects with truncating mutations were significantly more likely to have symptoms before 20 years of age (p<0.001) and to develop at least two symptomatic CNS tumours in addition to vestibular schwannoma before 30 years (p<0.001). There were also significantly fewer multigenerational families with truncating mutations. Four further truncating mutations were in mosaic form and were associated with milder disease than other similar mutations. This large study has confirmed the previous impression that truncating mutations are associated with severe disease, but caution has to be exercised in using mutation type to predict disease course.","['neurofibromatosis', 'bilateral vestibular schwannomas', 'vestibular schwannomas', 'schwannomas', 'CNS tumours', 'tumours', 'vestibular schwannoma', 'schwannoma', 'associated with milder disease than other similar mutations']","['0006746', '0009589', '0009588', '0100008', '0100006', '0002664', '0009588', '0100008', '0003813']","[64, 93, 103, 114, 899, 903, 926, 937, 1128]","[81, 125, 125, 125, 910, 910, 947, 947, 1187]"

Ube3a is imprinted with silencing of the paternal allele in hippocampus and cerebellum in mice. We found that the phenotype of mice with maternal deficiency (m-/p+) for Ube3a resembles human AS with motor dysfunction, inducible seizures, and a context-dependent learning deficit. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely impaired in m-/p+ mice despite normal baseline synaptic transmission and neuroanatomy, indicating that ubiquitination may play a role in mammalian LTP and that LTP may be abnormal in AS. The cytoplasmic abundance of p53 was increased in postmitotic neurons in m-/p+ mice and in AS, providing a potential biochemical basis for the phenotype through failure to ubiquitinate and degrade various effectors.","['papilloma', 'motor dysfunction', 'seizures', 'learning deficit']","['0012740', '0001270', '0001250', '0001328']","[110, 392, 421, 455]","[119, 409, 429, 471]"
9811917,"Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented.

We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing.

The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases.

Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.","['acoustic neuromas', 'vestibular schwannomas', 'schwannomas', 'tumor', 'acoustic neuromas', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumors', 'neurologic deficits', 'acoustic neuromas']","['0009588', '0009588', '0100008', '0002664', '0009588', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0000707', '0009588']","[86, 105, 116, 188, 461, 651, 715, 837, 1039, 1110, 1569, 2183]","[103, 127, 127, 193, 478, 656, 720, 842, 1044, 1116, 1588, 2200]"

We have identified 15 patients from a series of 537 with unilateral vestibular schwannomas who also had one or more of the following: other tumours (10/15), features of NF2 (3/15), or a family history of neurogenic tumours (5/15). No germline NF2 mutations were detected and in 7/9 cases where tumour material was available for analysis a germline mutation in the NF2 gene has been excluded. Although a possibility of gonosomal mosaicism still exists, exclusion tests for the offspring are now possible.

Application of this strategy suggests that most instances of unilateral vestibular schwannoma which do not fulfil criteria for NF2 represent chance occurrences.","['unilateral vestibular schwannomas', 'vestibular schwannomas', 'schwannomas', 'young age', 'young', 'neurofibromatosis', 'bilateral disease', 'neurogenic tumours', 'tumours', 'unilateral vestibular schwannomas', 'vestibular schwannomas', 'schwannomas', 'tumours', 'neurogenic tumours', 'tumours', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'sporadic', 'familial cases', 'tumours', 'unilateral vestibular schwannoma', 'vestibular schwannoma', 'schwannoma']","['0009590', '0009588', '0100008', '0003593', '0003593', '0006746', '0009589', '0004375', '0002664', '0009590', '0009588', '0100008', '0002664', '0004375', '0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0003745', '0000005', '0002664', '0009590', '0009588', '0100008']","[26, 37, 48, 72, 72, 120, 170, 215, 226, 311, 322, 333, 394, 458, 469, 548, 810, 841, 854, 872, 971, 982, 993]","[59, 59, 59, 81, 77, 137, 187, 233, 233, 344, 344, 344, 401, 476, 476, 554, 816, 849, 868, 879, 1003, 1003, 1003]"

9949213,"Transcribed, low-copy repeat elements are associated with the breakpoint regions of common deletions in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. We report here the identification of the ancestral gene ( HERC2 ) and a family of duplicated, truncated copies that comprise these low-copy repeats. This gene encodes a highly conserved giant protein, HERC2, that is distantly related to p532 (HERC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) implicated in vesicular trafficking. The mouse genome contains a single Herc2 locus, located in the jdf2 (juvenile development and fertility-2) interval of chromosome 7C. We have identified single nucleotide splice junction mutations in Herc2 in three independent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced jdf2 mutant alleles, each leading to exon skipping with premature termination of translation and/or deletion of conserved amino acids. Therefore, mutations in Herc2 lead to the neuromuscular secretory vesicle and sperm acrosome defects, other developmental abnormalities and juvenile lethality of jdf2 mice. Combined, these findings suggest that HERC2 is an important gene encoding a GEF involved in protein trafficking and degradation pathways in the cell.","['developmental abnormalities', 'juvenile lethality']","['0001263', '0004149']","[972, 1004]","[999, 1022]"
