10196695,Angelica syndrome (AD) is a neurological development disorder caused by the lack of a maternal contribution to chromosome 15q11-q13. There are four classes of AS by molecular or cytogenetic status: 15q11-q13 maternal microdeletion (approximately 70% of patients); uniparental uniparental (UPD); Defects in an alleged printing center (IM); The fourth group comprises 20 to 30% of people with biparental inheritance and a normal allelic methylation pattern in 15q11-q13. It has recently been found that mutations in UBE3A cause this latter group. Few studies have examined phenotypic differences between these classes. Twenty non-deletions were compared to 20 patients with age deletion and significant phenotypic differences were found between the two groups. The most severe phenotype in the deletion group can indicate a coherent gene syndrome.,"['Neuro-developmental disorder', 'coherent gene syndrome'.]","['0000707', '0001466']"
10417280,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angel syndrome (EA) are different neurological behavior disorders that are most often due to a 4 MB deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during maternal and maternal gametogenesis. With a de novo frequency of approximately 67-1 / 10,000 deliveries, these deletions represent a frequent structural change in the chromosome in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, regions were characterized that have two groups of proximal intersections and one distal cluster included. New DNA sequences that may be associated with cutpoints have been positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids of rodents, YAC contigs and fish from normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicate sequences (the last iterations) at or near the border points. The final repeat units come from large genomic duplications of a new gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germ tissue. One of the five PWS / AS patients analyzed so far has an identifiable and rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. It is postulated that the end repeats the 15q11-q13 edge by mediating homologous recombination, resulting in the deletion. In addition, we suggest that active transcription of these repeats into male and female gametes can facilitate the process of homologous recombination.","[""Neurobehavioral Disorders"", ""de Novo""]","['0000708', '0003745']"

10771486,"Skin schwanomas are common in patients with neurofibromatosis 2. In about a quarter of cases, skin tumors are the first clinical symptoms of this disease. The detection of skin tumors in connection with neurofibromatosis-2 is therefore important for the early detection of neurofibromatosis 2, especially in pediatric patients. In this study, we examined 40 skin tumors (36 schwannomas and 4 neurofibromas) from 20 neurofibromatosis 2 patients for NF2 mutations and allele loss. NF2 mutations in the blood were identified in 15 (75%) of the 20 patients. We found NF2 mutations in five (13%) and loss of NF2 allele in 18 (45%) of the 40 tumors analyzed. Genetic changes (allele loss or mutation) were found in 50 (63%) of the 80 alleles examined. Changes in both NF2 alleles were found in 17 (43%). These results suggest that, like vestibular swanomas and meningiomas, the loss of the functional product of the NF2 gene is also the critical event in the development of skin swans. Identification of the genetic changes in the NF2 gene in skin tumors can help identify skin tumors associated with neurofibromatosis-2, support the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2 in ambiguous cases, and rule out neurofibromatosis 1 in unclear cases.

The molecular genetic analysis of the NF2 gene was completed in peripheral blood samples in all 45 and in 28 tumor samples. Pathogenic NF2 mutations were not identified in any of the blood samples. Point mutations of NF2 were identified in 21/28 (75%) tumor samples and loss of heterozygote (LOH) in 21/28 (75%) tumor samples. Both mutation effects were identified in 18/28 (65%) tumor samples. A mutation was confirmed in a multilobular tumor (presumably in the first stroke) that was common to different foci of the tumor, while the second mutation event differed between the foci. The molecular findings in this patient were consistent with the somatic mosaicism for NF2, and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of two meningiomas in an MRI follow-up. Another patient developed a contralateral vestibular schwanoma in an MRI follow-up examination in which none of the shortening mutations of the vestibular schwanoma were present in the blood. It is important to recommend patients with unilateral vestibular schwanoma to (1) identify those at risk of bilateral disease, (2) those at risk of developing other tumors, and (3) other family members who are at risk of developing NF2. The comparison of tumor and blood DNA cannot rule out mosaicism in the index case and therefore cannot be used to predict those who are at risk of developing new tumors. However, the identification of both mutations or another LOH mutation in the tumor and the exclusion of these mutations in the blood samples of the siblings or offspring of the affected case can be sufficient to make screening of these relatives unnecessary.","[""Neurofibromatosis"", ""Unilateral Vestibular Schwanoma"", ""Vestibular Schwanoma"", ""Schwannoma"", ""Young"", ""Young Age"", ""Bilateral Disease"", ""Unilateral Vestibular Schwanoma"", ""Vestibular Schwanoma"". , ""Schwannoma"", ""tumor"", ""tumor"", ""tumor"", ""tumor"", ""tumor"", ""tumor"", ""somatic mosaicism"", ""meningioma"", ""contralateral vestibular schwanoma"", ""vestibular schwanoma"".

We present the clinical and radiological data from three unrelated families in which 12 members share the same heterozygous CDMP-1 mutation, an insert (insG206), resulting in an image shift that is likely to cause functional haploinsufficiency. Although eight mutation carriers show BDC, four have normal hands and feet, which confirms the non-penetrability of BDC with CDMP-1 mutations. In addition, multiple carriers have other skeletal anomalies, such as: B. Severe bilateral vertical talus (in two), development of hip dysplasia (in one) and short stature (in two, not affected). Premature spinal disease was observed in four mutation carriers, and three were associated with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.

This finding is consistent with the expression of CDMP-1 in human hypertrophic chondrocytes that are present in the epiphyses of the spinal ring. The phenotypic variation of BDC was attributed to the heterogeneity of the site or the different functional effects of different CDMP-1 mutations. The remarkable range of phenotypes caused by this identical CDMP-1 mutation in these families underlines the crucial role of the genetic background, the stochastic variation and / or the environmental factors in the modification of the observed phenotype.

We describe a particularly instructive case that raises important questions about the mechanisms that produce uniparent uniparental uniparental, and the evaluation of which provides evidence that trisomy in a fetus can precede uniparental uniparental. Chorionic villus tests performed for the advanced age of the mother showed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells, although the fetus appeared normal. Chromosomal analysis of amniocytes obtained after 15 weeks was normal in more than 100 cells examined. The boy was hypotensive at birth and high resolution stripes showed no 15q11-13 deletion, a deletion found in 50% -70% of PWS patients. Over time, the typical properties of the PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed that the mother is uniparental. Maternal disjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by normal sperm, followed by the loss of the paternal 15, is a likely cause of limited placental mosaicism and uniparental uniparental in this case of PWS, and an advanced age of the mother can be a predisposing factor. .",['Hypotonic at birth.'],['0008935']

1362220,"Angelica syndrome (AD) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have become classic examples of genomic imprinting in humans, since the absence of maternal (AS) or paternal inputs creates completely different phenotypes (PWS) in the q11-13 region of chromosome 15 as a result of a uniparental deletion or uniparental. Most patients appear to be sporadic. The genetic mechanism underlying the family has long been puzzling. There have recently been indications of an autosomal dominant inheritance of a detectable or undetectable defect in one or more 15q11-13 genes that are genomically imprinted. The present work describes an unusually large family tree with a separation of the maternal inheritance and an obvious asymptomatic transmission by different male ancestors. Deletion and paternal uniparentality were excluded in 15q11-13. However, the genetic defect is still localized in this region as we have received a maximum LOD score of 5.40 for binding to the GABA receptor GABRB3 locus and the anonymous DNA marker D15S10 that is in or next to this the critical area was mapped as 15q11-13. The size of the family tree made it possible to calculate an odds ratio in favor of the genomic impression of 9.25 x 10 (5).

The flank markers for this gene were previously defined as centromeric D22S1 and telomeric D22S28 repeats. Identifying the subregions in this area that are consistently rearranged in NF2-related tumors could help to better define the location of the disease. To this end, tumor and constitutional DNAss isolated from 39 patients unrelated to sporadic acoustic neuromas and associated NF2, meningiomas, swanomas, and ependymomas were compared at eight polymorphic sites on chromosome 22. Two of the tumors examined showed loss patterns of heterozygote, which is consistent with the presence of terminal deletions from chromosome 22.

The limit occurred between the haplotype markers D22S41 / D22S46 and D22S56. This finding redefines the proximal flank marker and localizes the NF2 gene between markers D22S41 / D22S46 and D22S28. In addition, a sporadic acoustic neuroma was identified that shows a heterozygous loss pattern consistent with mitotic recombination or deletion and reduplication.

In a small group of patients, the disease is due to an impression defect (ID) that silences the maternal UBE3A allele. The presence of a weak maternal band, detected by SNURF-SNRPN locus-specific methylation-specific PCR analysis in about a third of patients with an ID but no deletion from the pressure center, indicated that these patients were are ID cell mosaics and normal cells. A somatic mosaicism by molecular or cellular cloning was detected in two examined patients. X-inactivation studies on a patient's cloned fibroblasts suggest that the ID occurred before the blastocyst phase. To quantify the degree of mosaicism, a new quantitative methylation assay based on real-time PCR was developed. In 24 patients analyzed, the percentage of normal cells ranged from <1% to 40%. Regression analysis suggests that patients with a higher percentage of normally denatured cells tend to have milder clinical symptoms than patients with a lower percentage.

The results of various experiments show that the functions of human UBE3A and its counterpart to the fly, dube3a, are similar. First, Dube3a expression is enriched in the Drosophila nervous system, including the fungal body, the place of learning and the memory. Secondly, dube3a null mutants were created that appear normal on the outside, but show abnormal movement behavior and circadian rhythms as well as faulty long-term memory. Third, flies that overexpress Dube3a in the nervous system also show locomotion defects depending on the activity of the ubiquitin ligase. Finally, mutations with bad meaning in the UBE3A alleles of patients with Angelica syndrome change the conserved amino acid residues in the fly protein and behave like mutations with loss of function when introduced into dube3a. The simplest model for Angelica syndrome is that, in the absence of UBE3A, the specific substrates are not ubiquitinated and proteasomally worsen, accumulate in the brain and impair brain function. We have generated useful flies for genetic testing to identify Dube3a substrates. These flies overexpress Dube3a in the eye or wing and show morphological anomalies depending on the critical catalytic cysteine. We conclude that the dube3a mutants are a valid model for Angelica syndrome and have great potential for identifying elusive UBE3A substrates that are relevant to the disease.","[""Neurological Disorder"", ""Severe Mental Disability"", ""Mental Disability"", ""Delay"", ""Loss of Motor Coordination"", ""Sleep Disorders""]","['0000707', '0002187', '0001249', '0001249', '0002275', '0002360']"

3092103,"The use of recombinant DNA techniques has identified two basic mechanisms of tumorigenesis in humans. The first involves a qualitative or quantitative change in an oncogene (see ref. 1 for an overview). In the second case, which was discovered in embryonic tumors, a primary mutation occurs that is recessive at the cellular level to the normal allele. The growth of a tumor occurs only after a secondary change, such as chromosome loss or mitotic recombination, which eliminates the normal allele and thereby exposes the changed allele. Since its effects are recessive, the primary mutation can also occur and be transmitted in the germ tract, which leads to a known pattern for the disease. Independent bilateral tumors are common in familial cases because tumors result from a single event - the loss of normal genes - that can occur in any cell. This is in contrast to unknown (sporadic) cases in which individual tumors are due to the rare occurrence of two rare events within the same cell. Using a molecular genetic approach, we have shown that acoustic neuroma, one of the most common tumors in the human nervous system, is specifically associated with the loss of genes on human chromosome 22 and may be a result of the tumorigenesis mechanism discovered in embryonic tumors. This finding could provide an indication of the chromosomal position of the defective gene in bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by bilateral acoustic neuromas. Given the frequent occurrence of meningiomas in patients with bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis and the association of meningiomas with chromosome loss 22 previously described in cytogenetic studies, we suggest that a common event of tumorigenesis occurs in acoustic neuromas and meningiomas.","[""Tumors"", ""Tumors"", ""Tumors"", ""Sporadically"", ""Tumors"", ""Acoustic Neuroma"", ""Tumors of the Human Nervous System"", ""Tumors"", ""Tumors"", ""Bilateral Acoustic Neurofibromatosis"". , ""Neurofibromatosis"", ""autosomal dominant disorder"", ""autosomal dominant"", ""dominant"", ""bilateral acoustic neuromas"", ""acoustic neuromas"", ""meningiomas"", ""bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis"", ""neurofibromatosis"", 'meningioma', 'acoustic neuros , 'Meningioma']","['0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0003745', '0002664', '0009588', '0004375', '0002664', '0002664', '0009589', '0006746', '0000006', '0000006', '0000006', '0009589', '0009588', '0002858', '0009589', '0006746', '0002858', '0009588', '0002858']"

Specific loss of alleles on chromosome 22 was detected using polymorphic DNA markers in two acoustic neuromas, two neurofibromas and one meningioma from BANF patients.

The two neurofibromas were among the three removed from the same patient and both showed a loss of identical alleles, indicating that the same chromosome was deleted in both tumors. The third neurofibroma in this patient had no detectable loss of heterozygote, suggesting the possibility of a more subtle mutation event affecting chromosome 22. Only a part of chromosome 22 was removed from the two acoustic neuromas, which narrowed the possible chromosome site. of the gene that causes BANF in the distal region of the D22S9 locus in band 22q11.

3134615,"At least eight preliminary categories of neurofibromatosis have been proposed. Among these, neurofibromatosis 1 (from Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis) and neurofibromatosis 2 (central or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis) have been established as various diseases. 15 affected men and 8 affected women from a large family with neurofibromatosis 2 were examined.

Meningiomas and ependymomas were more common in young patients; Those who initially showed acoustic neuromas were almost a decade longer. Non-tumor intracranial calcifications were present in most patients and were also found in children without symptoms. The presence of these lesions is likely a prodromal feature of neurofibromatosis 2.

The results in 53 patients and a review of the literature document both the most important and the least known manifestations of the disorder. The odontogenic keratocyst, which usually occurs in adolescence, is clearly prone to recurrence. In addition to skin tumors, milia, epidermoid cysts, chalacia, comedones and the palmar and plantar fossa are common. Skin tumors that were originally thought to be independent of solar radiation are more common in sun-exposed areas, are much less common, and occur much later in blacks than in whites. There is evidence that skin radiation promotes skin cancer in this disorder. Unilateral linear nevoid carcinomas of the basal cells with comedones can represent a post-zygotic somatic mutation. There is a tendency to other forms of malignancy. Patients with this syndrome had medulloblastoma, meningioma, ovarian fibroma, ovarian fibrosarcoma, jaw fibrosarcoma, cardiac fibroma, fetal rhabdomyoma and mesenteric lymph or chylus cysts. In addition to the usual treatment modalities, topical immunotherapy and topical 5-fluorouracil have been used successfully. Oral synthetic retinoids such as 13-cis-retinoic acid have been used to prevent the appearance of new lesions and to stop the growth of older lesions by inducing differentiation. Independent observations of elevated prostaglandin levels associated with both the expansion of odontogenic keratocysts and the aggression of basal cell cancer require further investigation, both as a basic cellular mechanism and as a possible basis for treatment (e.g. with antiprostaglandins).

To assess possible heterogeneity, subjects were assigned to three proposed subtypes (representing mild, moderate, and severe NF2) based on age of onset, the presence or absence of CNS tumors other than vestibular schwannomas, and the presence or absence of retinal amaromas. Comparisons between the three subtypes for many clinical parameters showed that patients in the mild subtype differed from those in the other two subtypes for most parameters, but none of the parameters patients in the intermediate subtype differed from those of the differently severe subtype.

7905534,"Angelica syndrome (AD) is due to the lack of maternal contribution from chromosome 15q11-13, which in most cases comes from the de novo deletion or rarely from the uniparental uniparental. These families are associated with a low risk of recurrence. However, in a minority of families, more than one child is affected. Except for one, no deletion was found in these families. The type of inheritance in these families is an autosomal dominant footprint that has been modified. Sporadic cases with no observable deletion are therefore a dilemma of the Council, as there is a risk of recurrence of up to 50%. We present a series of 93 patients who show the relative contribution of these different genetic mechanisms. 81 patients were sporadic, while 12 were from six families. 60 cases showed deletions in 15q11-13, which were detected by a set of highly polymorphic n-repeat markers and conventional RFLPs. Ten sporadic cases and the 12 family cases had no detectable deletion. In addition, two cases of de novo deletions occurred on chromosome 15 with pericentric inversion. In one of them, the boy had a cousin with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which came from a de novo deletion in an inv (15) inherited from his father. One case resulted from a balanced maternal t (9; 15) (P24; q15) translocation. There were three cases of uniparental uniparental. Five patients were critically monoallelic for all loci across the minimal region, but the presence of a deletion cannot be confirmed. In family cases, all affected siblings inherited the same mother's chromosome 15 markers for the 15q11-13 region. Two cases with Novo deletion were observed, which started near the D15S11 locus (IR4-2R) and provided clues to the development of classics and smaller deletions. Cytogenetic analysis was found to be limited in its ability to detect deletions and could only detect 42 out of 60 cases. However, cytogenetic analysis remains essential to detect chromosomal abnormalities other than deletions such as inversions and balanced translocations, since both are at higher risk of deletion.

These patients show a pronounced variability in clinical appearance, ranging from a very serious illness with numerous tumors at a young age to a relatively mild condition much later in life. To investigate whether this phenotypic heterogeneity is determined by the type of mutation in NF2, clinical information was collected on 111 NF2 cases from 73 different families, which were examined for mutations in this gene. 67 people (56.2%) out of 41 of these relatives found 36 different disease-causing mutations.

This study shows the cytogenetic and molecular characterization of germline deletions in one patient with a chromosomal 9q22 deletion and in a second patient with a 9q22-Q3L deletion. Both have typical features of Gorlin syndrome as well as additional findings, including intellectual disability, conductive hearing loss, and failure to thrive. The fact that Gorlin syndrome can be caused by zero mutations (deletions) rather than activation of mutations has several effects. First, this study, along with previous analyzes of tumor allele loss, provides evidence that associated malignancies occur with inactivation of homozygous genes. In addition, the dominant mutations of the XPAC and FACC1 genes can be excluded as the cause of Gorlin syndrome, since the two patients described have zero mutations. Finally, the phenotypic characteristics that show variable expression must be influenced by genetic origin, epigenetic effects, somatic mutations or environmental factors, since these two patients have identical changes (deletions) to the Gorlin syndrome gene somewhat differently than Gorlin syndrome .","[""autosomal dominant"", ""autosomal dominant"", ""basal cell carcinoma"", ""medulloblastoma"", ""ovarian fibroids"", ""developmental disorders"", ""significant phenotypic variability within and between relatives"", ""variability"" phenotypically.

Cytogenetic findings suggest that the TBS mutant gene is associated with chromosome 16q 12.1, where SALL1 (formerly known as HSAL1), a human homologue of cleft (salt), is located. SAL is a development regulator in Drosophila melanogaster and is preserved throughout evolution. Mutations in salt-like vertebrate genes have so far not been attributed to a phenotype. The expression patterns of the salt-like genes in mice, Xenopus and fish medicines, as well as the finding that Medaka salt is regulated by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH; Ref. 11) prompted us to test SALL1 as a candidate gene for TBS. Here we show that SALL1 mutations cause TBS in a family with vertical transmission of TBS and in a family that is not related to an occasional case of TBS. Both mutations are predicted as the result of a prematurely terminated SALL1 protein that lacks all DNA binding domains. Therefore, TBS represents another human development disorder caused by mutations in a putative C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor.","[""autosomal dominant"", ""dominant"", ""anal, kidney, limb and ear abnormalities"", ""ear abnormalities"", ""sporadically""]","['0000006', '0000006', '0004378', '0000598', '0003745']"

9556704,"Prader-Willi and Angelan syndrome are two clinically different diseases associated with multiple anomalies and intellectual disabilities. They are only discussed together because they have a similar and rare genetic basis: they are genes that are located in the same region of the genome and are characterized by genetic imprinting. This normal process has contributed to these 2 complex and severe conditions by inactivating 1 copy of the genes relevant to each disorder: the maternal copy of the genes for Prader-Willi syndrome in the proximal 15q is usually silent and a 1 gene parent copy for Angelica syndrome at 15q is usually silent. In both diseases, the abnormality occurs when the normally active copy of the gene or genes is missing. Because the genes of these two disorders are very close and the center that is involved in inactivating the genes involved in the imprint can be the same, these two disorders usually result from the same chromosomal deletion. The results of the disorder depend on the parent of chromosome 15 origin being removed. Both Prader-Willi and Angelan syndrome can also occur when both members of chromosome 15 are from a parent, which is known as uniparental uniparental. Both of these can also result from a structural abnormality of the embossing center known as a printed mutation. Angelica syndrome can also be caused by a mutation in the gene that causes it. There is no comparable cause in Prader-Willi syndrome because it is due to an abnormality in more than one gene. Finally, despite the complexity of the possible causes, all mutations in the Angel syndrome gene can be detected with the exception of the only ones with methylation-sensitive DNA probes, since DNA methylation is the process by which the genes of these two diseases are printed. This rare property of certain areas of DNA holds great promise for the future treatment of these and other pressure-related disorders by reversing the printing process.","['intellectual disability.', 'disability']","['0001249', '0001249']"
9557895,"The causal heterogeneity of Angel Syndrome (AS) makes information about the risk of recurrence important and challenging and can have a dramatic impact on reproductive decision making for the nuclear and extended families. Most cases result from the typical large de novo deletions of 15q11-q13 and a low (<1%) risk of recurrence is expected. As a result of the uniparental paternal uniparental (UPD), which occurs without parental translocation, a recurrence risk of <1% is expected. Parental transmission of a structurally or functionally unbalanced chromosomal complement can lead to 15q11-q13 deletions or UPD and lead to case-specific recurrence risks. In cases where no large deletion or UPD is evident, the risk of recurrence due to a mutation in the maternal inheritance impression center (HF) or an ubiquitin gene mutation can be up to 50%. Ligase protein (UBE3A). People with similar characteristics who have none of these abnormalities make up a significant proportion of the cases, and some may have a 50% risk of recurrence.
