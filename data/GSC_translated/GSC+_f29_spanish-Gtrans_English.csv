3,10196695,Angelica syndrome (AD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the absence of a maternal contribution to chromosome 15q11-q13. There are four classes of AS according to molecular or cytogenetic status: 15q11-q13 maternal microdeletion (approximately 70% of patients); uniparental uniparental (UPD); defects in an alleged print center (IM); the fourth includes 20-30% of individuals with biparental inheritance and a normal allelic methylation pattern in 15q11-q13. Mutations of UBE3A have recently been identified as causing this latter group. Few studies have investigated phenotypic differences between these classes. Twenty non-deletions were compared to 20 patients with age deletion and significant phenotypic differences were found between both groups. The most severe phenotype in the deletion group may suggest a contiguous gene syndrome.,"['neurodevelopmental disorder', 'contiguous gene syndrome.']","['0000707', '0001466']"
4,10417280,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angel syndrome (EA) are different neurobehavioral disorders that most often originate from a 4 MB deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis, respectively. At a de novo frequency of approximately 67-1 / 10,000 deliveries, these deletions represent a common structural change of the chromosome in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, regions containing two groups of proximal cut points and one distal cluster have been characterized. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with cutpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analysis of rodent somatic cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and fish from normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicate sequences (the final repeats) at or near the cut-off points. The final repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a new gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germ tissues. One of the five PWS / AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable and rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. The end is postulated to repeat the 15q11-q13 flank by mediating homologous recombination resulting in deletion. Furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells can facilitate the process of homologous recombination.","['neurobehavioral disorders', 'de Novo']","['0000708', '0003745']"

Although the VWS gene has not yet been identified, it has been localized to within 1.6 cM in the 1q32-41 region. To determine whether PPS and VWS represent allelic forms of the same gene, three families were genotypic for markers flanking and within the critical region.

11,10771486,"Schwanomas of the skin are frequently seen in patients with neurofibromatosis 2. In about a quarter of cases, skin tumors are the first clinical symptoms of this disease. Recognition of skin tumors related to neurofibromatosis-2 is therefore important for the early diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2, especially in pediatric patients. In this study we examined 40 skin tumors (36 schwannomas and 4 neurofibromas) of 20 neurofibromatosis 2 patients for NF2 mutations and allelic loss. NF2 mutations have been identified in the blood of 15 (75%) of the 20 patients. We found NF2 mutations in five (13%) and loss of NF2 allelic in 18 (45%) of the 40 tumors analyzed. Genetic alterations (allelic loss or mutation) were found in 50 (63%) of the total of 80 alleles examined. Alterations were found in both NF2 alleles in 17 (43%). These results suggest that, as in the case of vestibular schwanomas and meningiomas, the loss of the functional product of the NF2 gene is also the critical event in the development of cutaneous schwanomas. Identifying the genetic alterations of the NF2 gene in skin tumors can help to identify skin tumors associated with neurofibromatosis-2, aiding in the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 2 in ambiguous cases and excluding neurofibromatosis 1 in unclear cases.

Molecular genetic analysis of the NF2 gene was completed in peripheral blood samples in all 45 and in 28 tumor samples. No pathogenic NF2 mutations were identified in any of the blood samples. Point mutations of NF2 were identified in 21/28 (75%) tumor samples and loss of heterozygote (LOH) in 21/28 (75%) tumor samples. Both mutational impacts were identified in 18/28 (65%) tumor samples. In a multilobular tumor, a mutation was confirmed (presumably in the first stroke) that was common to different foci of the tumor, while the second mutational event differed between foci. The molecular findings in this patient were consistent with somatic mosaicism for NF2 and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed with the presence of two meningiomas on a follow-up MRI. Another patient developed a contralateral vestibular schwanoma on a follow-up MRI in which none of the truncating vestibular schwanoma mutations was present in the blood. It is important when advising patients with unilateral vestibular schwanomas to identify (1) those at risk for bilateral disease, (2) those at risk of developing other tumors, and (3) other family members at risk of developing NF2. Comparing the tumor and blood DNA cannot exclude mosaicism in the index case and therefore cannot be used to predict those at risk of developing new tumors. However, the identification of both mutations or one more LOH mutation in the tumor and the exclusion of these mutations in the blood samples of the sibs or descendants of the affected case may be sufficient to make screening unnecessary in these relatives.","['Neurofibromatosis', 'unilateral vestibular schwanoma.', 'Vestibular schwanoma.', 'Schwannoma', 'young', 'young age.', 'Bilateral disease.', 'Unilateral vestibular schwanoma.', 'Vestibular schwanoma.' , 'Schwannoma', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'somatic mosaicism.', 'Meningiomas',' contralateral vestibular schwanoma.

The gene encoding of IRF6 is located in the critical region of the van der Woude syndrome (VWS; OMIM 119300) locus on chromosome 1q32-q41 (ref 2, 3).

The overlapping and phenotypic linkage data suggest that these two disorders are allelic. We found a nonsense mutation in IRF6 in the affected twin of a pair of discordant monozygotic twins for VWS. Subsequently, mutations in IRF6 were identified in 45 additional unrelated families affected by VWS and different mutations in 13 families affected by PPS. Expression analyzes demonstrated elevated levels of Irf6 mRNA along the medial border of the fusion palate, tooth buds, hair follicles, genitalia, and skin.

In Cox models, the relative risk of mortality increased 1.13 times a year at age at diagnosis (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.18) and was 2.51 times higher in people with meningiomas compared to those without meningiomas (95% CI 1.38-4.57). The relative risk of mortality in patients treated in specialty centers was 0.34 compared to those treated in non-specialized centers (95%, 0.12-0.98). In a separate model, the relative risk of mortality in people with constitutional NF2 mutations was very low compared to those with other types of mutations (nonsense or frameshift mutations, junction point mutations, and large deletions), but IQ could not be well quantified because there was only one death among people with nonsense mutations. We conclude that age at diagnosis, the single most powerful predictor of mortality risk, is a useful index for patient counseling and clinical management (such as intracranial meningiomas).

Both families demonstrate significant intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity among affected individuals. Examination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has shown that affected individuals from both families share SNPs within the IHS consistent with that of a common founder.

Homozygous CDMP-1 mutations cause Hunter-Thompson and Diver types of acromesomelic and DuPan syndrome in humans, as well as brachypodism in mice, while heterozygous mutations cause type C brachydactyly (BDC). We report clinical and radiographic data from three unrelated families in which 12 members share the same CDMP-1 heterozygous mutation, one insert (insG206), resulting in a frameshift predicted to cause functional haploinsufficiency. Although eight mutation carriers show BDC, four have normal hands and feet, confirming the non-penetrability of BDC with CDMP-1 mutations. In addition, several carriers have other skeletal abnormalities, such as severe bilateral vertical talus (in two), developing hip dysplasia (in one), and short stature (in two, unaffected). Premature spinal plate disease was observed in four mutation carriers and was associated with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in three of them. Axial skeletal involvement associated with CDMP-1 mutations has not been previously described. This finding is consistent with the expression of CDMP-1 in human hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are present in the ring epiphyses of the vertebral endplates. Phenotypic variation in BDC has been attributed to locus heterogeneity or the varied functional effects of different CDMP-1 mutations. The remarkable range of phenotypes caused by this identical CDMP-1 mutation in these families emphasizes the crucial role of genetic background, stochastic variation, and / or environmental factors in modifying the observed phenotype.

We describe a particularly instructive case that raises important questions about the mechanisms that produce uniparental uniparental and the evaluation of which provides evidence that trisomy can precede uniparental uniparental in a fetus. Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells, although the fetus appeared normal. The chromosomal analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 weeks was normal in more than 100 studied cells. The boy was hypotonic at birth, and high-resolution banding did not reveal the 15q11-13 deletion, a deletion found in 50% -70% of PWS patients. Over time, the typical characteristics of the PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal uniparental. Maternal disjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm, followed by the loss of the paternal 15, is a probable cause of confined placental mosaicism and uniparental uniparental in this case of PWS, and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor. .",['hypotonic at birth.'],['0008935']

43,1362220,"Angelica syndrome (AD) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have become classic examples of genomic imprinting in man, as completely different phenotypes are generated by the absence of maternal (AS) or paternal input (PWS) to the q11-13 region of chromosome 15 as a result of uniparental deletion or uniparental. Apparently, most of the patients are sporadic cases. The genetic mechanism underlying the family has long remained enigmatic. Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance of a detectable or undetectable defect in a 15q11-13 gene or genes, subject to genomic imprinting. The present work describes an unusually large pedigree with segregation of maternal inheritance and an apparent asymptomatic transmission through various male ancestors. Deletion and paternal uniparental were excluded in 15q11-13. However, the genetic defect is still localized in this region, as we obtained a maximum LOD score of 5.40 for binding to the GABA receptor GABRB3 locus and the anonymous DNA marker D15S10, which have been mapped into or adjacent to the critical region as 15q11-13. The size of the pedigree allowed calculating an odds ratio in favor of the genomic impression of 9.25 x 10 (5).

The flank markers for this gene have previously been defined as D22S1 centromeric and D22S28 telomeric repeats. Identifying the subregions in this range that are consistently rearranged in NF2-related tumors could help to better define the disease locus. To do this, tumor and constitutional DNAss, isolated from 39 patients unrelated to sporadic acoustic neuromas and associated NF2, meningiomas, schwanomas, and ependymomas, were compared at eight polymorphic loci on chromosome 22. Two of the tumors studied showed patterns of loss of Heterozygous, consistent with the presence of terminal deletions of chromosome 22.

The cut-off point occurred between the D22S41 / D22S46 and D22S56 haplotype markers. This finding redefines the proximal flank marker and locates the NF2 gene between the D22S41 / D22S46 and D22S28 markers. Furthermore, a sporadic acoustic neuroma was identified that reveals a pattern of heterozygote loss consistent with mitotic recombination or deletion and reduplication, which are mechanisms not previously seen in studies of these tumors.

59,15385437,"Angelica syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of function of the UBE3A gene printed in 15q11-q13. In a small group of patients, the disease is due to an impression defect (ID) that silences the maternal UBE3A allele. The presence of a weak maternal band detected by SNURF-SNRPN locus-specific methylation-specific PCR analysis in approximately one-third of patients who have an ID but no deletion from the print center suggested that these patients are ID cell mosaics and normal cells. In two studied patients, somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular and cellular cloning, respectively. X-inactivation studies of cloned fibroblasts from one patient suggest that ID occurred before the blastocyst phase. To quantify the degree of mosaicism, a new quantitative methylation assay was developed based on real-time PCR. In 24 analyzed patients, the percentage of normal cells ranged from <1% to 40%. Regression analysis suggests that patients with a higher percentage of normally denatured cells tend to have milder clinical symptoms than patients with a lower percentage. In conclusion, we suggest that the role of mosaic print defects in mental retardation is undervalued.","['somatic mosaicism.', 'mental retardation.', 'retardation']","['0001442', '0001249', '0001249']"

First, Dube3a expression is enriched in Drosophila's nervous system, including fungal bodies, the seat of learning, and memory. Secondly, dube3a null mutants have been generated, which appear normal externally, but show abnormal locomotor behavior and circadian rhythms and faulty long-term memory. Third, flies that overexpress Dube3a in the nervous system also show locomotion defects, depending on the activity of the ubiquitin ligase. Finally, bad sense mutations in the UBE3A alleles of patients with Angelica syndrome alter the conserved amino acid residues in the fly protein, and when introduced into dube3a, behave like loss-of-function mutations. The simplest model for Angelica syndrome is that, in the absence of UBE3A, the concrete substrates are not ubiquitinated and proteasomally deteriorate, accumulate in the brain, and interfere with brain function. We have generated useful flies for genetic screens to identify Dube3a substrates. These flies overexpress Dube3a in the eye or wing and show morphological abnormalities, depending on the critical catalytic cysteine. We conclude that the dube3a mutants are a valid model for Angelica syndrome, with great potential to identify elusive UBE3A substrates relevant to the disease.","['neurological disorder.', 'severe mental retardation.', 'mental retardation.', 'delay', 'loss of motor coordination.', 'sleep disorders']","['0000707', '0002187', '0001249', '0001249', '0002275', '0002360']"

In the latter case, the healthy mother had the same pericentric inversion, indicating that the patient also had a submicroscopic mutation on his other chromosome 15. These data map Angélica's locus to 15q11-13 and suggest that visible de novo deletions (associated with a low risk of recurrence) and autosomal recessive hereditary cases combine to give an overall risk of recurrence of IBS of less than 25%.","['mental retardation.', 'retardation', 'epilepsy', 'ataxia', 'happy disposition.', 'autosomal recessive inheritance.', 'autosomal recessive.', 'de Novo', 'autosomal recessive.']","['0001249', '0001249', '0001250', '0001251', '0100024', '0000007', '0000007', '0003745', '0000007']"

103,3092103,"The application of recombinant DNA techniques has identified two fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis in man. The first involves a qualitative or quantitative change in an oncogene (see Ref. 1 for review). In the second, discovered in embryonal tumors, a primary mutation occurs that is recessive at the cellular level to the normal allele. The growth of a tumor occurs only after a secondary change, such as chromosomal loss or mitotic recombination, eliminates the normal allele, thereby unmasking the altered allele. Because its effect is recessive, the primary mutation can also occur and be transmitted in the germinal tract, resulting in a familiar pattern for the disease. In familial cases, independent bilateral tumors are common, since tumors result from a single event - loss of normal genes - that can occur in any cell. This is in contrast to unfamiliar (sporadic) cases in which solitary tumors result from the infrequent occurrence of two rare events within the same cell. Using a molecular genetic approach, we have shown that acoustic neuroma, one of the most common tumors of the human nervous system, is specifically associated with the loss of genes on human chromosome 22 and may be a consequence of the mechanism of tumorigenesis discovered in embryonic tumors. This finding could provide a clue to the chromosomal location of the defective gene in bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, an autosomal dominant disorder with the hallmark of bilateral acoustic neuromas. In view of the frequent occurrence of meningiomas in patients with bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis and the Association of meningioma with loss of chromosome 22 previously described in cytogenetic studies, we suggest that a common event underlies tumorigenesis in acoustic neuroma and meningioma.","['tumors', 'tumors', 'tumors', 'sporadic', 'tumors', 'acoustic neuroma.', 'tumors of the human nervous system.', 'tumors', 'tumors', 'bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis.' , 'neurofibromatosis', 'autosomal dominant disorder.', 'autosomal dominant.', 'dominant', 'bilateral acoustic neuromas.', 'acoustic neuromas.', 'meningiomas', 'bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis.', 'neurofibromatosis', 'meningioma', 'acoustic neuroma.', 'meningioma']","['0002664', '0002664', '0002664', '0003745', '0002664', '0009588', '0004375', '0002664', '0002664', '0009589', '0006746', '0000006', '0000006', '0000006', '0009589', '0009588', '0002858', '0009589', '0006746', '0002858', '0009588', '0002858']"

The two neurofibromas were among three taken from the same patient, and both showed loss of identical alleles, demonstrating that the same chromosome was deleted in both tumors. The third neurofibroma in this patient had no detectable loss of heterozygote, suggesting the possibility of a more subtle mutational event affecting chromosome 22. In the two acoustic neuromas, only a portion of chromosome 22 was removed, narrowing the possible chromosomal location. of the gene that causes BANF to the distal region of the D22S9 locus in band 22q11.

107,3134615,"At least eight provisional categories of neurofibromatosis have been proposed. Among them, neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis) and neurofibromatosis 2 (central or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis) have been established as different disorders. Fifteen affected males and 8 affected females of a large kindred with neurofibromatosis 2 were studied. None of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 1. Between 15 and 53 years of age, the patients had multiple tumors of the central nervous system of various types, mainly bilateral acoustic neuromas. Two or more tumors eventually developed in 20 of the patients; 9 had evidence of only bilateral acoustic neuromas. Meningiomas and ependymomas were more frequent among young patients; those that initially presented acoustic neuromas were almost a decade more. Non-tumor intracranial calcifications were present in most of the patients and were also found in children without symptoms. The presence of these lesions is probably a prodromal feature of neurofibromatosis 2. Simultaneous analysis of D22S1 and IGLV DNA markers for consistency with neurofibromatosis 2 indicates that the disease locus is near the center of the long arm of chromosome 22.

Findings in 53 patients and a review of the literature document both the main and least known manifestations of the disorder. The odontogenic keratocyst, which usually appears during adolescence, has a marked tendency to recur. In addition to skin tumors, milia, epidermoid cysts, chalazia, comedones, and the Palmar and plantar fossae are common. Skin tumors, initially considered independent of sun exposure, are more frequent in areas exposed to the sun and are much less frequent and occur at a much later age in blacks than whites. There is some evidence that radiation from the skin promotes the appearance of skin cancers in this disorder. Unilateral linear basal cell nevoid carcinomas with comedones may represent a postzygotic somatic mutation. There is a propensity for other forms of malignancy. Patients with this syndrome have had medulloblastoma, meningioma, ovarian fibroma, ovarian fibrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma of the jaws, cardiac fibroma, fetal rhabdomyoma, and mesentery lymph or chylous cysts.

The study included skin and neurological examinations, Audiometry, a complete ophthalmic examination with slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the lens and fundus, and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and, in some, the spinal column. The mean age of onset in 58 individuals was 20.3 years; Initial symptoms resulted from vestibular schwanomas (44.4%), other CNS tumors (22.2%), skin tumors (12.7%), and ocular manifestations including cataracts and retinal amartomas (12.7%). Five asymptomatic individuals were diagnosed by screening. Vestibular schwanomas were documented in 62 individuals (98.4%); Other findings included cataracts (81.0%), skin tumors (67.7%), spinal tumors (67.4%), and meningiomas (49.2%). Clinical manifestations and course were generally similar within families, but differed between families. To assess possible heterogeneity, affected individuals were assigned to three proposed subtypes (representing mild, intermediate, and severe NF2) based on age of onset, the presence or absence of CNS tumors other than vestibular schwannomas, and the presence or absence of retinal amartomas.

From 8 family cases, 3 siblings from a family presented a molecular deletion that included only 2 loci, D15S10 and GABRB3, which define the critical region for phenotypes. The parental origin of the deletion, in both sporadic and familial cases, was exclusively maternal and consistent with a hypothesis of genomic impression. Among sporadic and familial cases without deletion, uniparental uniparental was not found and most of them inherited chromosomes 15 from both parents (biparental inheritance). A discrepancy between the cytogenetic and molecular deletion was observed in 14 (26%) of 53 patients in whom a cytogenetic analysis could be performed. Ten (43%) of the 23 patients with a normal karyotype had a molecular deletion and 4 (13%) of 30 patients with a cytogenetic deletion, of (15) (q11q13), had no molecular deletion.

The mode of inheritance in these families is an autosomal dominant imprint modified. Sporadic cases, with no observable deletion, therefore pose a Council dilemma, as there could be a risk of recurrence as high as 50%. We present a series of 93 as patients, showing the relative contribution of these different genetic mechanisms. 81 as patients were sporadic cases, while 12 cases came from six families. 60 cases presented deletions in 15q11-13 detected by a set of highly polymorphic n-repeat markers and conventional RFLPs. ten sporadic cases and the 12 family cases had no detectable deletion.

One case arose from a balanced maternal t (9; 15) (P24; q15) translocation. There were three cases of uniparental uniparental. Five patients were monoallelic for all loci throughout the minimal region as critical, but the presence of a deletion cannot be confirmed. In familial cases, all affected sibs inherited the same maternal chromosome 15 markers for the 15q11-13 region. Two cases with a Novo deletion were observed, beginning near the D15S11 locus (IR4-2R), providing evidence for the development of classics as well as with smaller deletions. Cytogenetic analysis proved to be limited in its ability to detect deletions, detecting only 42 out of 60 cases.

We have used this group of nine markers to construct chromosomal haplotypes 22 for the 82 at-risk individuals in this pedigree group.

Risk prediction was possible in all cases where DNA was available from both parents. 53 of 70 (76%) informative individuals were assigned a decreased risk of being carriers. The use of chromosome probes 22 for risk assessment should result in a very small number of individuals requiring periodic screening for NF2.","['Neurofibromatosis', 'dominant inheritance.', 'Tumors', 'tumors of the central nervous system.', 'Bilateral vestibular schwanomas.', 'Vestibular schwanomas.', 'Schwannomas']","['0006746', '0000006', '0002664', '0100006', '0009589', '0009588', '0100008']"

Several classes of genes have been implicated in controlling the development of distal extremities including genes that contain homeobox (MSX1, MSX2) some members of the homeobox gene family, and genes that encode growth factors of the FGF, TGF, and PDGF families. Homeobox (Hox) genes are a family of developmental control genes activated early in embryogenesis that encode positional information along the anterior-posterior body axis and specify different spatial domains within limb development. Growth factor genes can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of various embryonic structures, including limb buds, and have been shown to influence Hox gene expression.

Patients in some families develop many tumors at an early age and have a rapid clinical progression, while in other families, patients may have no symptoms until much later, and vestibular schwanomas may be the only tumors. The NF2 gene has been cloned from chromosome 22q; Most of the identified microbacterial mutations produce a truncated protein and severe NF2. To search for additional mutations and clinical correlations, CET analysis was used to detect DNA from 32 unrelated patients. Twenty different mutations were identified in 21 patients (66%): 10 nonsense mutations, 2 mutagenic, 7 junction mutations and 1 large deletion in the picture. Clinical information on 47 patients from the 21 families included ages at onset and diagnosis, number of meningiomas, spinal and skin tumors, and the presence of cataracts and retinal abnormalities. Clinical findings in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were compared to those with splice mutations. When each patient was considered as an independent random event, the two groups differed (P <OR = 0.05) for almost all variables. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were younger at baseline and at diagnosis, with higher and average frequency of tumors, supporting the correlation between absurd and frameshift mutations and severe NF2. When each family was considered as an independent random event, statistically significant differences were observed between both groups only in the mean ages of onset and at the time of diagnosis.

174,8755919,"The gene predisposing to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) on human chromosome 22 has revealed a wide variety of different mutations in NF2 individuals. These patients show marked variability in clinical presentation, ranging from a very serious disease with numerous tumors at an early age to a relatively mild condition much later in life. To investigate whether this phenotypic heterogeneity is determined by the type of mutation in NF2, clinical information has been collected on 111 NF2 cases from 73 different families that have been screened for mutations in this gene. 67 individuals (56.2%) from 41 of these relatives found 36 different disease-causing mutations. These include 26 truncated protein alterations (frameshift deletions / insertions and nonsense mutations), 6 junction point mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 base substitution in the 3 'UTR of the NF2 cDNA and a single insertion in the frame of 3 PA. Seventeen of these mutations are novel, while the remaining 19 have been previously described in other NF2 or sporadic tumors. When individuals harboring truncating protein mutations are compared to cases with single codon abnormalities, a significant correlation (P <0.001) with clinical outcome is observed. Twenty-four of the 28 patients with mutations causing premature truncation of the NF2 protein, schwannomin, have severe phenotypes. In contrast, all 16 cases in three families with mutations that affect only a single amino acid have mild NF2.

All affected individuals share certain key characteristics, but there is significant phenotypic variability within and between relatives with respect to malformations. The gene (NBCCS) is mapped to chromosome 9q22, and loss of allelic at this location is common in tumors from patients with Gorlin syndrome. Two cancer-predisposing recessive syndromes, pigmentosum xeroderma group A (XPAC) and Fanconi anemia group C (FACC), map to NBCCS region; and unusual and dominant mutations in these genes have been proposed to cause Gorlin syndrome. This study presents the cytogenetic and molecular characterization of germline deletions in one patient with a chromosomal 9q22 deletion and in a second patient with a 9q22-Q3L deletion. Both have typical features of Gorlin syndrome plus additional findings, including mental retardation, conductive hearing loss, and failure to thrive. That Gorlin syndrome can be caused by null mutations (deletions) rather than by activating mutations has several implications. First, together with previous analyzes of allelic loss in tumors, this study provides evidence that associated malignancies appear with homozygous gene inactivation. Furthermore, the dominant mutations of the XPAC and FACC1 genes can be ruled out as the cause of Gorlin syndrome, since the two patients described have null mutations. Finally, the phenotypic characteristics that show a variable expression must be influenced by genetic origin, epigenetic effects, somatic mutations or environmental factors, since these two patients with identical alterations (deletions) of the Gorlin syndrome gene have somewhat different from Gorlin syndrome.","['autosomal dominant.', 'autosomal dominant disorder.', 'basal cell carcinomas.', 'medulloblastoma', 'ovarian fibroids.', 'developmental defects.', 'significant phenotypic variability within and between relatives.', 'variability phenotypic.

In order to examine phenotypic variability in NBCCS and highlight functionally important domains of the PTCH protein, we have screened 71 unrelated NBCCS individuals for mutations in PTCH exons. We identified 28 mutations that are distributed throughout the gene, and the majority (86%) cause protein truncation. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate that failure of an NBCCS family to show a clear link to chromosome 9q 22.3-31 is more likely due to germline mosaicism. We have identified three families carrying identical mutations with variable phenotypes, suggesting that phenotypic variability in NBCCS is a complex genetic event. No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between the position of the truncation mutations and the main clinical characteristics. Two erroneous mutations have been identified, and their location within the transmembrane domains supports the notion that PTCH may have a transport function. The preponderance of truncation mutants in the germ line of NBCCS patients suggests that developmental defects associated with the disorder are more likely due to haploinsufficiency.","['basal cell carcinoma.', 'sporadic', 'basal cell carcinomas.', 'phenotypic variability.', 'variability', 'variable phenotypes.', 'variable', 'phenotypic variability.', 'variability', 'defects developing.']","['0002671', '0003745', '0002671', '0003812', '0003812', '0003813', '0003813', '0003812', '0003812', '0001263']"

SAL is a developmental regulator in the Drosophila melanogaster and is conserved throughout evolution. No phenotype has yet been attributed to mutations in vertebrate salt-like genes. The expression patterns of the salt-like genes in mice, Xenopus and fish medaka, and the finding that medaka salt is regulated by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH; Ref. 11), prompted us to examine SALL1 as a candidate gene for TBS. Here we demonstrate that SALL1 mutations cause TBS in a family with vertical transmission of TBS and in a family unrelated to a sporadic case of TBS. Both mutations are predicted as a result of a prematurely terminated SALL1 protein that lacks all DNA-binding domains.

192,9556704,"The Prader-Willi and Angelan syndromes are two clinically distinct disorders associated with multiple abnormalities and mental retardation. They are only discussed together because they share a similar and rare genetic basis: they involve genes that are located in the same region of the genome and are characterized by genetic imprinting. This normal process has contributed to these 2 complex and severe conditions through the inactivation of 1 copy of the genes relevant to each disorder: the maternal copy of genes for Prader-Willi syndrome in the proximal 15q is normally silent, and one 1 gene parental copy for Angelica syndrome at 15q is normally silent. In both disorders, when the normally active copy of the gene or genes is absent, the abnormality results. Since the genes of these 2 disorders are located very close, and since the center involved in the inactivation of the genes involved in the impression may be the same, these two disorders usually result from the same Chromosomal Deletion; The results of the disorder depend on the parent of origin of chromosome 15 that is removed. Both Prader-Willi and Angelan syndrome can also occur as a result of both members of chromosome 15 being derived from one parent, a condition known as uniparental uniparental. Both can also be a consequence of a structural abnormality of the imprinting center, known as a printed mutation. Also, Angelica syndrome can be caused by a mutation in the gene that causes it; a comparable cause is not present in Prader-Willi syndrome, as it results from abnormality in more than one gene. Finally, despite the complexity of the possible causes, all mutations of the Angel syndrome gene, except the only one, can be detected using DNA probes sensitive to methylation, since DNA methylation is the process by which the genes of these 2 disorders are printed. This infrequent property of specific areas of DNA holds promise for the future treatment of these and other printing-related disorders through reversal of the printing process.","['mental retardation.', 'retardation']","['0001249', '0001249']"

AS a consequence of the uniparental Paternal uniparental (UPD), which occurs in the absence of a parental translocation, it is expected to have a recurrence risk of <1%.
