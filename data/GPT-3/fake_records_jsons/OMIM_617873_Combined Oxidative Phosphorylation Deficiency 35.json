{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617873", "DISEASE": "Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 35", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 35 present clinical features that include a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from isolated muscle weakness to severe multisystem disease. This is due to the fact that this disease is caused by mutations in different genes that are involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The clinical presentation of the disease is therefore variable and ranges from isolated muscle weakness to severe multisystem disease. Some special cases also present with a milder phenotype.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in different genes that are involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
