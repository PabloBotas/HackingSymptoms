{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:300088", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 9", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 9 present clinical features that include developmental delay, epilepsy, and movement disorders.\n\nThe Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 9 (EIEE9) gene is located on chromosome 17q21.3 and encodes a protein of unknown function. The EIEE9 gene is highly conserved in mammals,. Some special cases also present a rare phenotype, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and movement disorders.\n\nThe EIEE9 gene is highly conserved in mammals, and the gene product is expressed in the brain. The gene is also expressed in the placenta, but not in the heart, liver, kidney, or skeletal muscle.\n\nThe EIEE9 gene is expressed in the brain, and is expressed in the placenta, but not in the heart, liver, kidney, or skeletal muscle.\n\nThe EIEE9 gene is highly conserved in mammals, and the gene product is expressed in the brain. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 9 from similar diseases is that the EIEE9 gene is highly conserved in mammals, and the gene product is expressed in the brain.\n\nThe EIEE9 gene is highly conserved in mammals, and the gene product is expressed in the brain.
