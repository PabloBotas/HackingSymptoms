{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:618004", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 64", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 64 present clinical features that include seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene KCNQ2, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv7.2. The channel is expressed in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. The channel is a key regulator of neuronal excitability and. Some special cases also present with severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and mental retardation.\n\nThe clinical features of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 64 are highly variable. Some patients present with severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and mental retardation. Others present with seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems.
