{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:612164", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 4", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 4 present clinical features that include seizures, cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems. The clinical features of the disease are similar to those of other epileptic encephalopathies, such as West syndrome, Dravet syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The disease is caused by a mutation in the SCN2A gene, which enc. Some special cases also present an abnormal EEG pattern.\n\nThe disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 4 is caused by a mutation in the SCN2A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na1.1.\n\nThe disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 6 is an autosome), and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.\n\n. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 4 from similar diseases is that it presents a normal EEG pattern.\n\nThe disease is caused by a mutation in the SCN2A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na1.1.
