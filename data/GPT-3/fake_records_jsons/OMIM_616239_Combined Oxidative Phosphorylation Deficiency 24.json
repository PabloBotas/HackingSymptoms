{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:616239", "DISEASE": "Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 24", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 24 present clinical features that include developmental delay, hypotonia, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and respiratory failure. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with COXPD24.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nWe performed a retrospective study of all patients with COXPD24 who were. Some special cases also present in the literature were included.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nWe identified 11 patients with COXPD24, including 2 previously unreported cases. All patients presented with developmental delay, hypotonia, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and respiratory failure. Some patients also presented with dysmorphic features, seizures, or abnormal electroencephalogram. The most common mutations were p.Gly108Arg (n = 6) and p.Gly113Arg (n = 4).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nCOXPD24 is a rare disease with a wide spectrum of clinical features. The most common. The main symptomatic differences of Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 24 from similar diseases is that the clinical features are usually more severe and the respiratory failure is the first symptom.", "SUMMARY": "\n\n\"\n\nMy son's teacher is asking him to explain what this means.
