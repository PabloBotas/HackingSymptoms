{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:300848", "DISEASE": "Mental Retardation, X-linked 89", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Mental Retardation, X-linked 89 present clinical features that include mental retardation, seizures, and a variety of dysmorphic features. In addition, the patients have an increased risk of developing malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors.\n\nThe gene responsible for this disorder is located on the X chromosome. The gene is a member of the superfamily. Some special cases also present a mutation in the gene.\n\nThe protein encoded by the gene is a member of the superfamily. The protein is a member of the GTPase superfamily. The protein is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is involved in the regulation of RhoA.\n\nThe protein is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is involved in the regulation of RhoA. The protein is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is involved in the regulation of RhoA. The protein is a GTPase-activating protein (G.
