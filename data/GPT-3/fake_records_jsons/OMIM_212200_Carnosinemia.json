{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:212200", "DISEASE": "Carnosinemia", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Carnosinemia present clinical features that include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, hyperinsulinism, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of Carnosinemia patients in a Brazilian cohort.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nWe conducted a retrospective study. Some special cases also present with neurological manifestations. We collected clinical data from medical records of patients with Carnosinemia from a Brazilian cohort.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nWe identified 16 patients with Carnosinemia. The mean age at diagnosis was 3.8 years (range: 0.5-14 years). The mean age at death was 6.8 years (range: 0.5-14 years). The mean age at death was significantly lower than the mean age at diagnosis (p = 0.000). The most common presenting symptoms were hypoglycemia (n = 12), hyperammonemia (n = 10), and hyperinsulin. The main symptomatic differences of Carnosinemia from similar diseases is that Carnosinemia patients present with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and hyperinsulinism.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nCarnosinemia is a rare disease that presents with a complex clinical picture. The main clinical features of Carnosinemia are hypoglycemia, hyperam", "SUMMARY": "monemia, and hyperinsulinism. The main symptomatic differences of Carnosinemia from similar diseases are hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and hyperinsulinism.\n\nThe paper is from a Brazilian cohort. My"}
