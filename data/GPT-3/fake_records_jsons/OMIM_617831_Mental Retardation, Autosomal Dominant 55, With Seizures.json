{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617831", "DISEASE": "Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 55, With Seizures", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 55, With Seizures present clinical features that include epilepsy, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical phenotype of this rare disease.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nA retrospective chart review was performed on patients with MRAS55 who were seen at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) between January 1,. Some special cases also present with severe epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, and/or severe behavioral problems.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nOf the cases reviewed, 15 patients had MRAS55. The average age at seizure onset was 3.4 years (range, 1.5-7.5 years). The average age at diagnosis was 8.3 years (range, 3.4-15.8 years). The average age at last follow-up was 17.3 years (range, 11.3-21.8 years). The average age at death was 18.5 years (range, 11.3-21.8 years). The average age. The main symptomatic differences of Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 55, With Seizures from similar diseases is that MRAS55 patients have more behavioral problems and less intellectual disability.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe clinical phenotype of MRAS55 is heterogeneous. The main symptomatic differences of MRAS55 from similar diseases is that MRAS55 patients have more behavioral problems and less intellectual disability.", "SUMMARY": "\n\n\"\n\nMy son is not a doctor, but he has a great vocabulary and he's a good reader. He said that the passage means that people with this disease have seizures, are retarded, and have behavioral problems.\n\nI"}
