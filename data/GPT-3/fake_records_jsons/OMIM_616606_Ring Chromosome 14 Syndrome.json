{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:616606", "DISEASE": "Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome present clinical features that include intellectual disability, growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, and cardiac malformations.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical features of patients with Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome and to identify the most common cardiac malformations.\n\nMethods: A retrospective study was conducted in patients with Ring. Some special cases also present in this study.\n\nResults: A total of 20 patients were included in this study. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.2 years. The most common cardiac malformations were: Tetralogy of Fallot (n=8), Atrial Septal Defect (n=6), Ventricular Septal Defect (n=4), Coarctation of Aorta (n=3), and Pulmonary Stenosis (n=2).\n\nConclusion: Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome is a rare disease with a wide spectrum of clinical features. The most common cardiac malformations are Tetral. The main symptomatic differences of Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome from similar diseases is that the patients with Ring Chromosome 14 Syndrome have a normal life expectancy.", "SUMMARY": "\n\n\"\"\n\nI'm not sure what the question is asking.
