{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617020", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 38", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 38 present clinical features that include seizures, cognitive impairment, and motor impairment. The clinical phenotype is highly variable, with the severity of the disease ranging from mild to severe. The genetic basis of this disease is unknown. We performed whole exome sequencing of a family with a severe phenotype and identified a de novo missense mutation in the gene CAC. Some special cases also present with an early onset of seizures, but with a milder phenotype. The genetic basis of this disease is unknown. We performed whole exome sequencing of a family with a severe phenotype and identified a de novo missense mutation in the gene CAC.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 38 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by early onset of seizures, cognitive impairment, and motor impairment.
