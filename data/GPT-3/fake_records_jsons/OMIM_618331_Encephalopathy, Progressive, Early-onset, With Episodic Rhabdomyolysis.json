{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:618331", "DISEASE": "Encephalopathy, Progressive, Early-onset, With Episodic Rhabdomyolysis", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Encephalopathy, Progressive, Early-onset, With Episodic Rhabdomyolysis present clinical features that include: early-onset progressive encephalopathy, episodic rhabdomyolysis, and recurrent infections. The most common underlying cause is a mutation in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1). The clinical phenotype is variable, and can include epilepsy. Some special cases also present with cerebral calcifications.\n\nThis is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence of 1:1,000,000. The disease is more common in males than in females.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the TPP1 gene. This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21.1). The gene encodes the enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase I, which is involved in the degradation of neuropeptides.\n\nThe disease is characterized by episodes of rhabdomyolysis, encephalopathy, and recurrent infections. The episodes of rhabdomy. The main symptomatic differences of Encephalopathy, Progressive, Early-onset, With Episodic Rhabdomyolysis from similar diseases is that it is characterized by early-onset, progressive encephalopathy, and episodic rhabdomyolysis.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the TPP1 gene.
