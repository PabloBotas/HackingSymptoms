{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:607208", "DISEASE": "Dravet Syndrome", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Dravet Syndrome present clinical features that include intractable seizures, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbance. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the SCN1A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na V 1.1. This mutation results in an increased permeability of the cell membrane to sodium ions, which leads. Some special cases also present a mutation in the SCN2A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na V 1.2. This mutation results in an increased permeability of the cell membrane to sodium ions, which leads to hyperexcitability of the neurons.\n\nThe drug has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Dravet Syndrome in a phase II clinical trial. The trial was conducted in the United States and enrolled 20 patients with Dravet Syndrome. The patients were treated with Epidiolex or placebo for 14 weeks. The patients treated with Epidiolex had a significant reduction in the frequency of conv. The main symptomatic differences of Dravet Syndrome from similar diseases is that the patients have intractable seizures, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbance.\n\nThe most common adverse events reported in the trial were somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and vomiting. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue", "SUMMARY": ", pyrexia, somnolence, and decreased appetite.\n\nThe drug has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Dravet Syndrome in a phase II clinical trial.
