{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:238970", "DISEASE": "Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria Syndrome", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria Syndrome present clinical features that include hyperammonemia, hyperornithinemia, hypoargininemia, hyperlysinemia, and hypoornithinemia.\n\nHyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria Syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC25A13 gene. Some special cases also present mutations in the SLC25A15 gene.\n\nHyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria Syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.\n\nFor more information on this disorder, please refer to. The main symptomatic differences of Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria Syndrome from similar diseases is that the patients with this syndrome present a very high level of ornithine in the blood.", "SUMMARY": "\n\nThere is no cure for this syndrome. The treatment is based on the control of the symptoms.\n\nHyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria Syndrome is a rare disease. It is estimated"}
