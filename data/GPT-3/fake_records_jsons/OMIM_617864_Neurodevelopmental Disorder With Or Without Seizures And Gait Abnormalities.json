{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617864", "DISEASE": "Neurodevelopmental Disorder With Or Without Seizures And Gait Abnormalities", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Neurodevelopmental Disorder With Or Without Seizures And Gait Abnormalities present clinical features that include gait abnormalities, seizures, developmental delay, and/or intellectual disability. These features are common in other disorders, which makes the diagnosis of Neurodevelopmental Disorder With Or Without Seizures And Gait Abnormalities difficult. The following clinical features are commonly seen in patients with Neurodevelopmental Disorder With Or Without Se. Some special cases also present with other clinical features such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or seizures.\n\nSeizures\n\nSeizures are involuntary movements or sensations that occur as a result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures are classified as either focal or generalized. Focal seizures occur when abnormal electrical activity is limited to one area of the brain. Generalized seizures occur when abnormal electrical activity affects the entire brain. The following seizure types are commonly seen in patients with Neurodevelopmental Disorder With Or Without Seizures And Gait Abnormalities.\n\nAbsence seizures\n\nAbsence seizures are characterized by a brief. The main symptomatic differences of Neurodevelopmental Disorder With Or Without Seizures And Gait Abnormalities from similar diseases is that patients with Neurodevelopmental Disorder With Or Without Seizures And Gait Abnormalities are also likely to have intellectual disability, gait abnormalities, and/or seizures.\n\nAbsence seizures are characterized by a brief.
