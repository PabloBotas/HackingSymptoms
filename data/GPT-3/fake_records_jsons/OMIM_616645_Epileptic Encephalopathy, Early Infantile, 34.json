{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:616645", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 34", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 34 present clinical features that include epilepsy, intellectual disability, and motor impairment. In addition, patients with this rare disease have an increased risk of developing malignancies. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 34 and to evaluate the impact of this rare disease. Some special cases also present an atypical phenotype. The study was conducted in the Neurology Department of the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 34 is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the PPT1 gene. This gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate phosphatase 1, which is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). PtdIns3P is a phospholipid that is. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 34 from similar diseases is that patients with this rare disease have an increased risk of developing malignancies. The main malignancies are acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and solid tumors.\n\nThe PPT1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q24.3). The gene is composed", "SUMMARY": " of 9 exons and 8 introns. The PPT1 gene encodes a protein of 585 amino acids. The protein is a phosphatase that is responsible for the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-3-"}
