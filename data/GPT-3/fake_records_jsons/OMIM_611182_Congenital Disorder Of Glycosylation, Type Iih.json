{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:611182", "DISEASE": "Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iih", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iih present clinical features that include developmental delay, dysmorphic features, recurrent infections, and malignancies. The underlying molecular defect in this disorder is a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GPT2). GPT2 is a member of the phosphotransferase. Some special cases also present with hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia, and hypomagnesemia.\n\nThe clinical features of patients with Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iih are similar to those of patients with Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iiia. The underlying molecular defect in this disorder is a deficiency in the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GPT2). GPT2 is a member of the phosphotransferase. Some special cases also present with hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia, and hyp. The main symptomatic differences of Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iih from similar diseases is that patients with Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iih present with developmental delay, dysmorphic features, recurrent infections, and malignancies.\n\nThe clinical features of patients with Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iii are similar to those of patients with Congenital", "SUMMARY": " Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iiia.
