{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:308350", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 1", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 1 present clinical features that include epileptic seizures, cognitive impairment, and motor impairment. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene KCNQ2, which encodes the Kv7.2 potassium channel. The Kv7.2 channel is expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability. The Kv7. Some special cases also present a phenotype of neonatal onset of seizures, which can be associated with a normal EEG. The epileptic encephalopathy is characterized by an abnormal EEG, with slow spike-wave discharges, and a high incidence of epileptic seizures.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the gene KCNQ2, which encodes the Kv7.2 potassium channel. The Kv7.2 channel is expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability. The Kv7.2 channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel that is expressed in the brain and is involved in the regulation of neuronal. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 1 from similar diseases is that the disease is characterized by a high incidence of epileptic seizures, and the presence of slow spike-wave discharges on the EEG.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the gene KCNQ2, which encodes the Kv7.2 potassium channel.
