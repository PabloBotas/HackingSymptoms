Patients with Liang-wang Syndrome present clinical features that include the following:\n\nIn addition to the above, patients with Liang-wang Syndrome may also present with the following:\n\nThe syndrome is named after Dr. Liang-wang Zhang, a Chinese pediatrician who first described the syndrome in a paper published in Chinese in 1980.\n\nLiang-wang Syndrome is. Some special cases also present with:\n\nThe syndrome is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol.\n\nThe syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective. The main symptomatic differences of Liang-wang Syndrome from similar diseases is that the former is caused by a mutation in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase gene, while the latter are caused by mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene.\n\nLiang-wang Syndrome is extremely rare, with only a few dozen cases reported worldwide.", "SUMMARY": "\n\nLiang-wang Syndrome is a rare disease.
