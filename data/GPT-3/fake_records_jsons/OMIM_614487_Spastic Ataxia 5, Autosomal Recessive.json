{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:614487", "DISEASE": "Spastic Ataxia 5, Autosomal Recessive", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Spastic Ataxia 5, Autosomal Recessive present clinical features that include spasticity, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and seizures.\n\nThis is a rare disease, with an incidence of 1:1,000,000. The disease is caused by mutations in the SPG4 gene.\n\nSpastic Ataxia 5, Autosomal Recess. Some special cases also present with seizures.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the SPG4 gene.\n\nThe SPG4 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q35).\n\nThe SPG4 gene encodes for the protein spastic paraplegia 4 protein.\n\nThe protein is a component of the cytoskeleton.\n\nThe protein is involved in the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nThe protein is also involved in the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton.\n\nThe protein is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.\n\nThe. The main symptomatic differences of Spastic Ataxia 5, Autosomal Recessive from similar diseases is that Spastic Ataxia 5, Autosomal Recessive presents with cognitive impairment.\n\nThe main clinical features of Spastic Ataxia 5, Autosomal Recessive are spasticity, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment, and seizures.\n\nThe main laboratory findings of Sp", "SUMMARY": "astic Ataxia 5, Autosomal Recessive are elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, normal serum creatine kinase, and normal serum pyruvate kinase.\n\nThe main histologic findings of Spastic Ataxia"}
