{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:254800", "DISEASE": "Myoclonic Epilepsy Of Unverricht And Lundborg", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Myoclonic Epilepsy Of Unverricht And Lundborg present clinical features that include seizures, movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and sleep disorders.\n\nMyoclonic Epilepsy Of Unverricht And Lundborg is caused by genetic mutations. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an autosome, and only. Some special cases also present a recessive pattern of inheritance.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called Cav1.2. This protein is a subunit of a calcium channel. Calcium channels are proteins that control the flow of calcium ions into a cell. Calcium ions are important for many cellular processes, including muscle contraction.\n\nThe CACNA1A gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 22.2. The gene contains 27 exons. Exons are regions of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins. Mut. The main symptomatic differences of Myoclonic Epilepsy Of Unverricht And Lundborg from similar diseases is that it is a rare genetic disorder that causes seizures and myoclonic seizures.\n\nMyoclonic Epilepsy Of Unverricht And Lundborg is a genetic disorder that causes seizures and myoclonic seizures. The disease is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. This gene provides instructions for", "SUMMARY": " making a protein called Cav1.2. This protein is a subunit of a calcium channel.
