{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:613839", "DISEASE": "Megaloblastic Anemia Due To Dihydrofolate Reductase Deficiency", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Megaloblastic Anemia Due To Dihydrofolate Reductase Deficiency present clinical features that include macrocytic anemia, neurological symptoms, and growth retardation. The disease is caused by mutations in the DHFR gene. The most common mutation is a G to A transition at nucleotide position 677 (677G>A) that results in a glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid position 172. Some special cases also present with a homozygous mutation at position 677 (677G>A).\n\nThe prevalence of this disease is estimated to be 1 in 1,000,000.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the DHFR gene.
