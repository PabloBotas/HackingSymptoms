{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:611721", "DISEASE": "Combined Saposin Deficiency", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Combined Saposin Deficiency present clinical features that include:\n\nCardiac disease\n\nRenal disease\n\nMusculoskeletal disease\n\nNeurological disease\n\nOphthalmological disease\n\nLiver disease\n\nGastrointestinal disease\n\nHepatic disease\n\nEndocrine disease\n\nLymphatic disease\n\n. Some special cases also present:\n\nMusculoskeletal disease\n\nRenal disease\n\nCardiac disease\n\nNeurological disease\n\nLiver disease\n\nGastrointestinal disease\n\nHepatic disease\n\nEndocrine disease\n\nLymphatic disease\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the SACS gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called saposin C. Saposin C is found in the membranes of cells in many tissues of the body. The protein is involved in the movement of cholesterol and other fats from the blood into cells.\n\nSaposin C is. The main symptomatic differences of Combined Saposin Deficiency from similar diseases is that it is associated with a higher frequency of renal disease and a lower frequency of cardiac disease.\n\nIn the kidney, saposin C is found in the membranes of cells that line the tubules of the nephron. The tubules are the tiny structures in the kidney that filter blood and form urine.
