{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:203700", "DISEASE": "Mitochondrial Dna Depletion Syndrome 4a (alpers Type)", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Mitochondrial Dna Depletion Syndrome 4a (alpers Type) present clinical features that include psychomotor retardation, ataxia, seizures, dysarthria, dysphagia, ophthalmoplegia, cardiomyopathy, hepatopathy, and dysmorphic features. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features of patients with Mitochondrial Dna Depletion Syndrome. Some special cases also present a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial. The main symptomatic differences of Mitochondrial Dna Depletion Syndrome 4a (alpers Type) from similar diseases is that it is a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome", "SUMMARY": " 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and a mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome 4a (alpers Type) and"}
