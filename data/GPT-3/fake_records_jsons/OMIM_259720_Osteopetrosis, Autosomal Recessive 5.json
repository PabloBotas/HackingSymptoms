{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:259720", "DISEASE": "Osteopetrosis, Autosomal Recessive 5", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Osteopetrosis, Autosomal Recessive 5 present clinical features that include skeletal deformities, mental retardation, seizures, and a variety of other symptoms. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of different mutations in the OPG gene. The severity of the symptoms is dependent on the type of mutation and the location of the mutation in the gene. The clinical features of Osteopet. Some special cases also present with renal failure, aplastic anemia, and skeletal dysplasia.\n\nThe most common symptoms of Osteopetrosis, Autosomal Recessive 5 are skeletal deformities, seizures, and mental retardation. Other symptoms include hearing loss, deafness, aplastic anemia, and renal failure. The severity of the symptoms is dependent on the type of mutation and the location of the mutation in the gene.\n\nSkeletal deformities are the most common symptom of Osteopetrosis, Autosomal Recessive 5. These deformities are caused by a lack of osteoclasts. The main symptomatic differences of Osteopetrosis, Autosomal Recessive 5 from similar diseases is that Osteopetrosis, Autosomal Recessive 5 patients have more severe skeletal deformities.\n\nThe most common skeletal deformities are a shortening of the long bones, a thickening of the skull, and a narrowing of the spinal canal. These deformities are caused by a lack of osteocl", "SUMMARY": "asts. Osteoclasts are cells that break down bone tissue. Without osteoclasts, the bones cannot be broken down and they become thick and dense.\n\nSeizures are the second most common symptom of Osteopetrosis,"}
