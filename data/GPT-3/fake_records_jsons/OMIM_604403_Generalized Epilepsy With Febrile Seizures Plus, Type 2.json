{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:604403", "DISEASE": "Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2 present clinical features that include:\n\nGeneralized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, type 2 is a rare genetic disorder. It is caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the Na+ channel alpha1 subunit. This protein is found in nerve cells in the brain and. Some special cases also present mutations in the SCN2A gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the Na+ channel alpha2 subunit. This protein is also found in nerve cells in the brain and.\n\nGeneralized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, type 2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.\n\nGeneralized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, type 2 is caused by mutations in the SC. The main symptomatic differences of Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2 from similar diseases is that the seizures are not provoked by fever. The main clinical features of Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 2 are:\n\nGeneralized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, type 2 is a rare genetic disorder.
