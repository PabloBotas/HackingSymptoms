{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:611364", "DISEASE": "Myoclonic Epilepsy, Juvenile, Susceptibility To, 4", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Myoclonic Epilepsy, Juvenile, Susceptibility To, 4 present clinical features that include epilepsy, intellectual disability, and ataxia. The clinical features of this disease are very similar to those of other rare diseases such as Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy with Excessive Daytime Sleepiness, Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy with Excessive Sleepiness, and Juvenile Myoclonic Ep. Some special cases also present with sleep disorders, such as sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and sleep apnea.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the EPM2A gene. The EPM2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit A (PPP2R1A). This protein is involved in the regulation of other proteins. The PPP2R1A protein is located in the cell nucleus.\n\nThe PPP2R1A protein is involved in the regulation of other proteins. The PPP2R1A protein is located in the cell nucleus.\n\n. The main symptomatic differences of Myoclonic Epilepsy, Juvenile, Susceptibility To, 4 from similar diseases is that it is characterized by the presence of ataxia.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the EPM2A gene.
