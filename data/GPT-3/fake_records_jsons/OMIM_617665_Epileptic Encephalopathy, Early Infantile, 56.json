{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617665", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 56", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 56 present clinical features that include epilepsy, cognitive impairment, motor impairment, and sleep disturbances. The genetic basis of this disease is a mutation in the KCNQ2 gene, which encodes the Kv7.2 voltage-gated potassium channel. The mutation is located in the pore region of the channel, which is responsible for the potassium. Some special cases also present with ataxia, developmental delay, and speech impairment. The mutation of the KCNQ2 gene is associated with the disease. The mutation is a single base pair substitution in the pore region of the channel. The mutation is a G-to-A transition at nucleotide position 896, which changes the amino acid glutamine to arginine. The mutation is located in the pore region of the channel, which is responsible for the potassium. The mutation is associated with the disease. The mutation is a single base pair substitution in the pore region of the channel. The mutation is a G-to-A transition. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 56 from similar diseases is that the disease is associated with a mutation in the KCNQ2 gene.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 56 is a rare disease.
