{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:618285", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 69", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 69 present clinical features that include epileptic seizures, developmental delay, motor impairment, microcephaly, and cognitive impairment. In addition, patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 69 have been reported to have other clinical features including psychomotor retardation, ataxia, and abnormal eye movements.. Some special cases also present with cardiac and respiratory abnormalities. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene, which encodes the protein, that is located on chromosome 15q13.3. The gene product is a member of the SNF2 family of proteins. The encoded protein is a DNA helicase that is involved in the regulation of transcription. The protein is a nuclear protein that is found in the nucleus. The protein is thought to be involved in the regulation of transcription.
