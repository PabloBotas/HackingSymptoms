{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617183", "DISEASE": "Harel-yoon Syndrome", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Harel-yoon Syndrome present clinical features that include congenital anomalies, developmental delay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and distinctive facial features. These patients have been described as having a \u201cmixed phenotype\u201d. The genetic basis of Harel-yoon Syndrome is unknown.\n\nIn the present study, the authors identified a mutation in the gene. Some special cases also present with a specific genetic mutation. The genetic mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene. The genetic mutation causes the gene to produce a defective protein. The defective protein can cause the disease.\n\nThe authors also identified a mutation in the gene. Some special cases also present with a specific genetic mutation.

The defective protein can cause the disease.\n\nThe authors also identified a mutation in the gene. Some special cases also present with a specific genetic mutation. The genetic mutation is a change in the. The main symptomatic differences of Harel-yoon Syndrome from similar diseases is that the patients with Harel-yoon Syndrome have distinctive facial features.\n\nThe genetic mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene.
