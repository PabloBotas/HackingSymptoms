{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:603204", "DISEASE": "Epilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 2", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 2 present clinical features that include mental retardation, developmental delay, autism, and epilepsy. The disease is caused by mutations in the NFXL1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.. Some special cases also present with a distinctive facial appearance.\n\nEpilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 2 is caused by mutations in the NFXL1 gene. The NFXL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called NFXL1. This protein is found in the membranes of cells in the brain. The protein is involved in a process called vesicle transport. Vesicles are small, membrane-bound sacs that transport proteins and other molecules within cells. NFXL1 is thought to be involved in the transport of proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface.\n\nThe NFXL1 gene is. The main symptomatic differences of Epilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 2 from similar diseases is that it presents with a distinctive facial appearance.\n\nThe NFXL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called NFXL1. This protein is found in the membranes of cells in the brain. The protein is involved in a process called vesicle transport. Vesicles are small, membrane-bound sacs", "SUMMARY": " that transport proteins and other molecules within cells. NFXL1 is thought to be involved in the transport of proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface.\n\nThe NFXL1 gene is located on the long (q) arm"}
