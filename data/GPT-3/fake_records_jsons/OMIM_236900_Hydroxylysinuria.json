{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:236900", "DISEASE": "Hydroxylysinuria", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Hydroxylysinuria present clinical features that include growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, kidney failure, hearing loss, and neurological impairment.\n\nIn the past, the diagnosis of Hydroxylysinuria was made by a combination of clinical and biochemical findings. However, the recent development of a genetic test has made the diagnosis of Hydroxylysinuria easier. Some special cases also present a positive family history.\n\nHydroxylysinuria is caused by mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene. This gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 (ALDH7A1), which is involved in the metabolism of the amino acid lysine.\n\nThe ALDH7A1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q24.31). The gene is composed of 8 exons and 7 introns. The gene produces a protein of 524 amino acids.\n\nThe ALDH7A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogen. The main symptomatic differences of Hydroxylysinuria from similar diseases is that the ALDH7A1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q24.31). The gene is composed of 8 exons and 7 introns. The gene produces a protein of 524 amino acids.\n\nThe ALDH7A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehyd", "SUMMARY": "rogenase 7A1 (ALDH7A1), which is involved in the metabolism of the amino acid lysine.\n\nThe ALDH7A1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q24.31"}
