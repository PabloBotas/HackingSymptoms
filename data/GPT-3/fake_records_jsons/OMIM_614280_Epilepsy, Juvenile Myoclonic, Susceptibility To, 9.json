{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:614280", "DISEASE": "Epilepsy, Juvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epilepsy, Juvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 present clinical features that include: epilepsy, myoclonus, cognitive impairment, developmental delay, autism, and/or sleep disorders. The clinical features of this disease are highly variable and often overlap with other diseases.\n\nJuvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A. Some special cases also present with mutations in the CACNA1H gene.\n\nJuvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 12 is an autosome), and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.\n\nJuvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 is diagnosed by genetic testing. Genetic testing is performed to confirm a diagnosis of Juvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9. The main symptomatic differences of Epilepsy, Juvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 from similar diseases is that it is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene.\n\nJuvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 is treated with anticonvulsants. The main symptomatic differences of Epilepsy, Juvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 from similar diseases is", "SUMMARY": " that it is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene.\n\nJuvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9 is a rare disease. The prevalence of Juvenile Myoclonic, Susceptibility To, 9"}
