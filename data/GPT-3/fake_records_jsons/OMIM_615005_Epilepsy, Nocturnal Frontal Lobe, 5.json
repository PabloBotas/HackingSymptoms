{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:615005", "DISEASE": "Epilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 5", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 5 present clinical features that include seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic behavior. The disease is caused by mutations in the SLC25A13 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). The ANT is a membrane protein that facilitates the transport of adenine nucleotides across the inner mitochondrial membrane.. Some special cases also present a mitochondrial myopathy. The clinical phenotype of Epilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 5 is highly variable, and the majority of patients have a normal life expectancy.\n\nEpilepsy, Nocturnal Frontal Lobe, 5 is caused by mutations in the SLC25A13 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT).
