{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:616640", "DISEASE": "Epilepsy, Progressive Myoclonic, 10", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epilepsy, Progressive Myoclonic, 10 present clinical features that include myoclonus, progressive ataxia, and cognitive decline. The disease is caused by a mutation in the CACNA1A gene, which encodes the \u03b11A subunit of the Cav1.2 calcium channel. This mutation leads to a loss of Cav1.2 channel function, which is. Some special cases also present a loss of Cav1.1 channel function.\n\nThe disease is caused by a mutation in the CACNA1A gene, which encodes the \u03b11A subunit of the Cav1.2 calcium channel.
