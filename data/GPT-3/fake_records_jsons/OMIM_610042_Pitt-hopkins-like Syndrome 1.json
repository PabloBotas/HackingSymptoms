{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:610042", "DISEASE": "Pitt-hopkins-like Syndrome 1", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Pitt-hopkins-like Syndrome 1 present clinical features that include microcephaly, intellectual disability, seizures, and severe developmental delay. The disease is caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene, which encodes a chromatin remodeling protein. The CHD7 gene is highly conserved in vertebrates, and its role in the development of the nervous system is well established. Some special cases also present additional features, such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, and behavioral problems. In this study, we present a case of a child with Pitt-Hopkins-like Syndrome 1 who presented with severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and behavioral problems. The patient was diagnosed with Pitt-Hopkins-like Syndrome 1, and a novel mutation in the CHD7 gene was identified. This case highlights the importance of genetic testing in patients with Pitt-Hopkins-like Syndrome 1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPitt-Hopkins-like Syndrome 1 (PTHS1) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CHD. The main symptomatic differences of Pitt-hopkins-like Syndrome 1 from similar diseases is that patients with PTHS1 present severe developmental delay, microcephaly, and behavioral problems. The disease is caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene, which encodes a chromatin remodeling protein. The CHD7 gene is highly conserved in vertebrates, and its role in the development of the", "SUMMARY": " nervous system is well established.
