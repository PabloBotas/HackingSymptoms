Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 68 present clinical features that include seizures, intellectual disability, and movement disorders. This phenotype is associated with a variety of mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3.\n\nThe disease is caused by a mutation in the SHANK3 gene. The SHANK3 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 22 (22q.
