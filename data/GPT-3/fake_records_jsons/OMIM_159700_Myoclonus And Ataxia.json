{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:159700", "DISEASE": "Myoclonus And Ataxia", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Myoclonus And Ataxia present clinical features that include cognitive impairment, ataxia, myoclonus, and epileptic seizures. This study aims to investigate the genetic and clinical characteristics of Myoclonus And Ataxia patients in a Brazilian cohort.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nWe performed a retrospective study of patients with Myoclonus And Atax. Some special cases also present other clinical features such as epilepsy, cognitive impairment, or ataxia.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nWe identified 18 patients with Myoclonus And Ataxia, and their clinical features were analyzed. The mean age at onset was 9.5 years (range, 3-16 years). The mean age at diagnosis was 17.2 years (range, 9-25 years). The mean age at last follow-up was 23.5 years (range, 18-32 years). The mean age at death was 26.3 years (range, 19-32 years). The mean age at onset of epilepsy was 15.2. The main symptomatic differences of Myoclonus And Ataxia from similar diseases is that it presents a late onset of epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and ataxia.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe clinical features of Myoclonus And Ataxia are similar to other diseases, but the late onset of epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and ataxia are distinctive.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017.", "SUMMARY": " Published by Elsevier B.V.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nThanks!"}
