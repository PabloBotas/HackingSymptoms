{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:614307", "DISEASE": "Alpha-methylacyl-coa Racemase Deficiency", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Alpha-methylacyl-coa Racemase Deficiency present clinical features that include severe neurological manifestations, which can be very difficult to diagnose. In this case report, we describe a patient with a clinical presentation of severe encephalopathy, who was initially diagnosed with encephalitis and later with mitochondrial encephalopathy. The patient was found to have a mutation in the AMACR gene. This is. Some special cases also present with the same symptoms as the patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy. The most common symptoms of AMACR deficiency are encephalopathy, psychomotor retardation, seizures, ataxia, spasticity, and myoclonus. The diagnosis of AMACR deficiency is based on the detection of a mutation in the AMACR gene. The diagnosis of AMACR deficiency is confirmed by the detection of a mutation in the AMACR gene. The diagnosis of AMACR deficiency is confirmed by the detection of a mutation in the AMACR gene.\n\nThe most common symptoms of AMACR deficiency are en.
