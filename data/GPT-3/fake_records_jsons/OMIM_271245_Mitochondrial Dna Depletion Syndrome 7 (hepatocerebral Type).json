Patients with Mitochondrial Dna Depletion Syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral Type) present clinical features that include hepatic failure, developmental delay, and epilepsy.\n\nThis study presents a case of a 2-year-old boy with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral type) who presented with a seizure disorder. The patient was treated with antiepileptic drugs and was discharged.\n\n. Some special cases also present with hepatic failure, developmental delay, and epilepsy. The case presented here is a 2-year-old boy with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral type) who presented with a seizure disorder.\n\nMitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral type) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the skeletal muscle, liver, and brain.\n\nMitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral type) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of multiple. The main symptomatic differences of Mitochondrial Dna Depletion Syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral Type) from similar diseases is that it is characterized by the presence of multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the skeletal muscle, liver, and brain.\n\nMitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral type) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA", "SUMMARY": " (mtDNA) in the skeletal muscle, liver, and brain.\n\nMitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 7 (hepatocerebral type) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of multiple deletions of mitochondrial"}
