{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:271980", "DISEASE": "Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency present clinical features that include: (1) acute encephalopathy, (2) seizures, (3) progressive neurodegeneration, (4) myopathy, (5) metabolic acidosis, (6) hypoglycemia, (7) hyperammonemia, (8) hypoketotic hypoglycemia,. Some special cases also present (9) microcephaly, (10) facial dysmorphism, (11) cardiac abnormalities, (12) ocular abnormalities, (13) and mental retardation.\n\nSuccinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency is a rare disease that affects both males and females equally. It is estimated that the prevalence of this disease is less than 1 in 1,000,000.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the \"SDHD\" gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a. The main symptomatic differences of Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency from similar diseases is that the symptoms are usually more severe and the onset of the disease is earlier.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the \"SDHD\" gene.
