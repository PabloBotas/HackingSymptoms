{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:614820", "DISEASE": "Alternating Hemiplegia Of Childhood 2", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Alternating Hemiplegia Of Childhood 2 present clinical features that include:\n\nCerebellar ataxia\n\nHemiparesis\n\nEpilepsy\n\nNeurological deficits\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Alternating Hemiplegia Of Childhood 2 are caused by a mutation in the SCN2A gene. The SCN2A gene is. Some special cases also present a mutation in the SCN1A gene.\n\nThe SCN2A gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q37.3). The SCN2A gene produces a protein called sodium channel alpha subunit. The SCN2A gene is responsible for the production of the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel. The voltage-gated sodium channel is a transmembrane protein that forms a pore in the cell membrane. The pore is responsible for the transmission of the action potential. The action potential is the electrical signal that travels along the axon of the neuron. The main symptomatic differences of Alternating Hemiplegia Of Childhood 2 from similar diseases is that the disease presents a periodic pattern of the symptoms.\n\nThe SCN2A gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q37.3).
