{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:616647", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 35", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 35 present clinical features that include epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and motor impairment.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 35 is caused by mutations in the EIEE35 gene. The EIEE35 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the brain and is involved in the development of. Some special cases also present with mental retardation, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphism.\n\nThe EIEE35 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 1 at position p13.2. The EIEE35 gene produces a protein called early infantile epileptic encephalopathy protein 35.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 35 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 35 from similar diseases is that it presents with early onset of seizures and with developmental delay.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 35 is caused by mutations in the EIEE35 gene. The EIEE35 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the brain and is involved in the development", "SUMMARY": " of.
