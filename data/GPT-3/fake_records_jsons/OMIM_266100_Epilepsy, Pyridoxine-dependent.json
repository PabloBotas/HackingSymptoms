{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:266100", "DISEASE": "Epilepsy, Pyridoxine-dependent", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epilepsy, Pyridoxine-dependent present clinical features that include seizures, developmental delay, autism, and other neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common genetic cause of Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a mutation in the SLC25A13 gene. The SLC25A13 gene encodes the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase sub. Some special cases also present with a mutation in the SLC25A22 gene. The SLC25A22 gene encodes the mitochondrial adenosine diphosphate (ADP) synthase sub.\n\nThe Epilepsy, Pyridoxine-dependent phenotype is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical features that include: seizures, developmental delay, autism, and other neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common genetic cause of Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a mutation in the SLC25A13 gene. The SLC25A13 gene encodes the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase sub. The main symptomatic differences of Epilepsy, Pyridoxine-dependent from similar diseases is that the disease is caused by a mutation in the SLC25A13 gene. The SLC25A13 gene encodes the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase sub. The SLC25A13 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q25.3", "SUMMARY": ").\n\nThe SLC25A13 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q25.3). The SLC25A13 gene is composed of 8 exons. The SLC25A13 gene encodes a"}
