Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy With Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy present clinical features that include progressive myoclonic epilepsy, myopathy, and neurodegeneration. We report a case of a patient with a novel mutation in the DNM2 gene, which is associated with the autosomal recessive form of Spinal Muscular Atrophy With Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy. The patient presented with. Some special cases also present with epileptic seizures.\n\nDystonia-plus syndromes are a group of rare, genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by the presence of dystonia and other movement disorders, including myoclonus, chorea, athetosis, and ballism. The genetic basis of these disorders is still unknown. We report a case of a young woman with a dystonia-plus syndrome who was found to have a novel mutation in the DNM2 gene. The patient presented with progressive myoclonic epilepsy, myopathy, and neurodegeneration.\n\nDystonia-plus syndromes are. The main symptomatic differences of Spinal Muscular Atrophy With Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy from similar diseases is that it is a progressive disease with a slow onset, and it is characterized by myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nSpinal Muscular Atrophy With Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy is a rare disease.
