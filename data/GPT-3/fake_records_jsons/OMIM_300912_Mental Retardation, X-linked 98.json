{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:300912", "DISEASE": "Mental Retardation, X-linked 98", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Mental Retardation, X-linked 98 present clinical features that include severe mental retardation, developmental delay, microcephaly, and characteristic facial features. The disease is caused by mutations in the ARX gene, which encodes a protein that is involved in the development of the brain and nervous system. The disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.\n\nAR. Some special cases also present a unique AR. The AR is a statistical measure of the probability that a person will develop a disease, based on the incidence of the disease in the population and the number of family members who have the disease. The AR is used to estimate the chance that a person will develop a disease.\n\nARX. ARX is a rare disease that is characterized by severe mental retardation, developmental delay, microcephaly, and characteristic facial features. The disease is caused by mutations in the ARX gene, which encodes a protein that is involved in the development of the brain and nervous system. The disease is inherited in an X. The main symptomatic differences of Mental Retardation, X-linked 98 from similar diseases is that Mental Retardation, X-linked 98 is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.\n\nMental Retardation, X-linked 98 is a rare disease that is characterized by severe mental retardation, developmental delay, microcephaly, and characteristic facial features.
