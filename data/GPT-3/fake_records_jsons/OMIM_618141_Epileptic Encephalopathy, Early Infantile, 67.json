{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:618141", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 67", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 67 present clinical features that include seizures, developmental delay, and autistic features. The disease is caused by mutations in the GABRG2 gene, which encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor subunit, GABRG2. This gene is expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, and mutations in. Some special cases also present behavioral problems, such as aggression, hyperactivity, and irritability.\n\nIn this study, researchers have identified a new gene, the GABRA5 gene, which is involved in the regulation of the GABAergic system. This gene is expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, and mutations in this gene are associated with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 67.\n\nThe researchers found that GABRA5 gene mutations are associated with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 67. They also found that the mutations in this gene are associated with the GABAergic system. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 67 from similar diseases is that patients with this disease present autistic features.\n\nThe researchers also found that the GABRA5 gene is expressed in the hippocampus, and that the mutations in this gene are associated with the GABAergic system.
