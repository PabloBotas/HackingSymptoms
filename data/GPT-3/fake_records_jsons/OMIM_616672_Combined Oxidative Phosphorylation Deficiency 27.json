{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:616672", "DISEASE": "Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 27", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 27 present clinical features that include: hypotonia, feeding difficulties, recurrent infections, developmental delay, respiratory failure, and death.\n\nThe gene encoding the mitochondrial ATP synthase 6 (ATP6) is located on chromosome 11p15.5. This gene is composed of 12 exons and encodes a protein of 1310 amino acids.. Some special cases also present with the presence of a point mutation in the ATP6 gene. This mutation is a substitution of the nucleotide cytosine for thymine at position 11,250 of the ATP6 gene. This mutation results in a premature stop codon at amino acid position 756. This mutation is known as the R756X mutation.\n\nThe ATP6 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q23.3). The ATP6 gene is located between the telomeric marker D11S939 and the centromeric marker D11S934. The ATP6 gene is approximately 20,938,. The main symptomatic differences of Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 27 from similar diseases is that it is a rare disease.\n\nThe ATP6 gene is composed of 12 exons. The ATP6 gene encodes a protein of 1310 amino acids. The ATP6 protein is composed of two transmembrane domains, a nucleotide binding domain, and a catalytic domain. The ATP6 protein is", "SUMMARY": " a component of the mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase. The ATP6 protein is a subunit of the F1 portion of the ATP synthase. The F1 portion of the ATP synthase is responsible for the synthesis of ATP from AD"}
