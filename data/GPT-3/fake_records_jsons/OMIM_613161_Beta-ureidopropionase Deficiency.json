{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:613161", "DISEASE": "Beta-ureidopropionase Deficiency", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Beta-ureidopropionase Deficiency present clinical features that include a broad spectrum of severity, from asymptomatic to severe metabolic crises. The main clinical features are related to hyperammonemia, including developmental delay, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, ataxia, dysarthria, spasticity, seizures, and coma. The severity of the disease is. Some special cases also present neurological manifestations, such as cortical atrophy, cortical calcifications, and cortical infarcts.\n\nThe diagnosis of Beta-ureidopropionase Deficiency is based on the detection of an increased concentration of ammonia in the blood and the identification of a deficiency of the enzyme beta-ureidopropionase in the blood or in cultured skin fibroblasts.\n\nThe mainstay of treatment is the use of a low-protein diet. This diet must be maintained throughout life.\n\nThe most important aspect of treatment is the prevention of acute metabolic crises. These crises are treated with intravenous administration of. The main symptomatic differences of Beta-ureidopropionase Deficiency from similar diseases is that the crises are less frequent and less severe.\n\nThe main clinical features of Beta-ureidopropionase Deficiency are related to hyperammonemia. The main manifestations are developmental delay, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, ataxia, dysarthria, spasticity, seizures,", "SUMMARY": " and coma. The severity of the disease is variable.
