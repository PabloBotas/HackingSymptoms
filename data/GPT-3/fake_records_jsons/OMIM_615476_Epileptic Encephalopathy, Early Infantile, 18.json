{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:615476", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 18", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 18 present clinical features that include developmental delay, epileptic seizures, and dysmorphic features.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 18 is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHD). SDHD is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to f. Some special cases also present a severe and early onset of epileptic seizures.\n\nSDHD is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. This reaction is essential for the production of energy in the mitochondria.\n\nSDHD is a member of the succinate dehydrogenase family, which is a complex of four subunits. The SDHD gene encodes the largest subunit of the complex.\n\nSDHD is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. This reaction is essential for the production of energy in the mitochondria.\n\nSDHD is a member of the. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 18 from similar diseases is that it is caused by mutations in the SDHD gene.\n\nSDHD is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate.
