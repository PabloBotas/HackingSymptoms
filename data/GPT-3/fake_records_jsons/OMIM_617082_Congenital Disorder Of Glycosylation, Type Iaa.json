{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617082", "DISEASE": "Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iaa", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iaa present clinical features that include neurological impairment, microcephaly, developmental delay, growth retardation, and failure to thrive. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical features of patients with CDG, Type Iaa and to compare them with patients with CDG, Type Ib.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nWe reviewed the clinical. Some special cases also present with additional features such as hepatosplenomegaly, seizures, and renal impairment.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nThe most common clinical features were developmental delay, microcephaly, and growth retardation. The most common laboratory findings were elevated levels of lactate, lactate/pyruvate ratio, and lactate/pyruvate/2-oxoglutarate ratio.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nPatients with CDG, Type Iaa present with similar clinical features as patients with CDG, Type Ib. However, the presence of additional features such as seizures, hepatosplenome. The main symptomatic differences of Congenital Disorder Of Glycosylation, Type Iaa from similar diseases is that it is a rare disease, and it is associated with neurological impairment.", "SUMMARY": "\n\n\"\"\"\n\nMy question is:\n\n1.
