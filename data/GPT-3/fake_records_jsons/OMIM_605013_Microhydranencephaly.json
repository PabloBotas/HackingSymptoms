{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:605013", "DISEASE": "Microhydranencephaly", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Microhydranencephaly present clinical features that include: microcephaly, microphthalmia, ptosis, arthrogryposis, hypotonia, seizures, mental retardation, and/or hydrocephalus. The severity of the clinical manifestations is variable, and the disease is progressive. The main clinical features are the microcephaly, microphthal. Some special cases also present other clinical features such as: arthrogryposis, ptosis, hypotonia, seizures, mental retardation, and/or hydrocephalus.\n\nMicrohydranencephaly is a rare disease. The prevalence is unknown.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the \"PHOX2B\" gene. The \"PHOX2B\" gene provides instructions for making a protein called paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 beta. This protein is involved in the development of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nThe \"PHOX2B\" gene is located on the short (p) arm. The main symptomatic differences of Microhydranencephaly from similar diseases is that the \"PHOX2B\" gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 7.\n\nThe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent", "SUMMARY": ") are required in order to be born with the disease. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.\n\nThis disease"}
