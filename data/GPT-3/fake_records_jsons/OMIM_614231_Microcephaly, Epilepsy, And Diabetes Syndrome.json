{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:614231", "DISEASE": "Microcephaly, Epilepsy, And Diabetes Syndrome", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Microcephaly, Epilepsy, And Diabetes Syndrome present clinical features that include microcephaly, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism.\n\nMicrocephaly, Epilepsy, And Diabetes Syndrome is associated with a mutation in the MECP2 gene. The MECP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called MeCP2. MeCP2. Some special cases also present with intellectual disability.\n\nMicrocephaly, Epilepsy, And Diabetes Syndrome is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. The MECP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called MeCP2. MeCP2 helps control the activity of other genes.\n\nMicrocephaly, Epilepsy, And Diabetes Syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome, and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.\n\nMicroceph. The main symptomatic differences of Microcephaly, Epilepsy, And Diabetes Syndrome from similar diseases is that it is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. The MECP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called MeCP2. MeCP2 helps control the activity of other genes.\n\nMicrocephaly, Epilepsy, And Diabetes Syndrome is caused by mutations in the MECP", "SUMMARY": "2 gene.
