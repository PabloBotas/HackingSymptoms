{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:602477", "DISEASE": "Febrile Seizures, Familial, 2", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Febrile Seizures, Familial, 2 present clinical features that include:\n\nFebrile Seizures\n\nFamilial\n\n2\n\nFebrile Seizures, Familial, 2 is associated with significant morbidity. The disease is associated with significant morbidity. Febrile Seizures, Familial, 2 is also associated with mortality.\n. Some special cases also present with a high mortality rate.\n\nFebrile Seizures, Familial, 2 is a rare disease.\n\nFebrile Seizures, Familial, 2 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called a voltage-gated calcium channel. Voltage-gated calcium channels are found in the membranes of certain nerve cells and muscle cells. These channels are critical for the normal transmission of signals from one nerve cell to another.\n\nVoltage-gated calcium channels are composed of four subunits. Each subunit. The main symptomatic differences of Febrile Seizures, Familial, 2 from similar diseases is that it is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called a voltage-gated calcium channel. Voltage-gated calcium channels are found in the membranes of certain nerve cells and muscle cells.
