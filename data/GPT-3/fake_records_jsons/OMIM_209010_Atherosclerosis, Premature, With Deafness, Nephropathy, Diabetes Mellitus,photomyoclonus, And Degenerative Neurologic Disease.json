Patients with Atherosclerosis, Premature, With Deafness, Nephropathy, Diabetes Mellitus,photomyoclonus, And Degenerative Neurologic Disease present clinical features that include hearing loss, visual impairment, and neurodegeneration. These patients have a complex clinical presentation that is not fully explained by the known genetic causes of these diseases. The complex clinical presentation of these patients is likely due to the presence of multiple genetic causes of these diseases. The complex clinical presentation of these patients is likely due. Some special cases also present with complex clinical presentations. For example, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) present with a complex clinical presentation that is not fully explained by the known genetic causes of MS. The complex clinical presentation of these patients is likely due to the presence of multiple genetic causes of MS.
