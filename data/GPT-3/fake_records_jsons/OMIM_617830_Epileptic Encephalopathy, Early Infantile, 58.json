{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617830", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 58", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 58 present clinical features that include seizures, developmental delay, and behavioral problems.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 58 is caused by mutations in the KCNT1 gene. The KCNT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 1 protein. This protein is found in. Some special cases also present with seizures, developmental delay, and behavioral problems.\n\nThe gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 at position 11. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain containing family. It is a voltage-gated potassium channel that is expressed in the central nervous system. The encoded protein is a tetrameric channel that is permeable to potassium and sodium ions. It is thought to play a role in the regulation of neuronal excitability.\n\nThe KCNT1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 at position 11. The protein encoded by this gene is a member. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 58 from similar diseases is that it is caused by mutations in the KCNT1 gene.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 58 is caused by mutations in the KCNT1 gene.
