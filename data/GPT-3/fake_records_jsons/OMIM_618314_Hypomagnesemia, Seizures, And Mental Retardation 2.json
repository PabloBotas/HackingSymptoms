{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:618314", "DISEASE": "Hypomagnesemia, Seizures, And Mental Retardation 2", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Hypomagnesemia, Seizures, And Mental Retardation 2 present clinical features that include seizures, mental retardation, and hypomagnesemia. The most frequent associated abnormalities include: seizures (80.0%), mental retardation (80.0%), and hypomagnesemia (80.0%). Among the associated abnormalities, the most frequent are: seizures (80.0%), mental retardation. Some special cases also present associated abnormalities like: seizures (80.0%), mental retardation (80.0%), and hypomagnesemia (80.0%).\n\nRare disease frequency\n\nThe disease is considered rare when it affects 1 person per 2,000. In USA, the frequency of Hypomagnesemia, Seizures, And Mental Retardation 2 is about 1 person per 2,000.\n\nAbout extrapyramidal movement disorders\n\nExtrapyramidal movement disorders are a group of movement disorders that are characterized by slow, writhing, twisting, repetitive movements. These disorders are usually associated with other neurological. The main symptomatic differences of Hypomagnesemia, Seizures, And Mental Retardation 2 from similar diseases is that it is characterized by seizures, mental retardation, and hypomagnesemia.\n\nExtrapyramidal movement disorders are caused by genetic mutations in the SCARB2 gene. The SCARB2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a transmembrane receptor protein. This protein is located in the", "SUMMARY": " membrane of certain nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The protein is involved in the transport of certain molecules into and out of nerve cells.\n\nThe SCARB2 gene mutations associated with extrapyramidal movement disorders lead to the production"}
