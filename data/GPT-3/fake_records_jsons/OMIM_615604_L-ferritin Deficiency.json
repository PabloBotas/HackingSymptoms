{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:615604", "DISEASE": "L-ferritin Deficiency", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with L-ferritin Deficiency present clinical features that include anemia, growth retardation, and hypopigmentation. These patients have a normal life expectancy and are not at risk for developing iron overload.\n\nL-ferritin Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the FTL gene. The FTL gene encodes the fer. Some special cases also present mutations in the FTH1 gene. The FTL gene is located on chromosome 4q21.3.\n\nThe diagnosis of L-ferritin Deficiency is based on the clinical manifestations and the presence of low serum ferritin levels. The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of mutations in the FTL gene.\n\nThe treatment of L-ferritin Deficiency is based on the administration of iron supplements.\n\nL-ferritin Deficiency is a rare disorder. The prevalence of this disorder is unknown.\n\nThe disease was first described in a Japanese family in 1996.\n\nThe disease is. The main symptomatic differences of L-ferritin Deficiency from similar diseases is that patients with L-ferritin Deficiency have normal serum iron levels and normal transferrin saturation.\n\nL-ferritin Deficiency is a rare disorder.
