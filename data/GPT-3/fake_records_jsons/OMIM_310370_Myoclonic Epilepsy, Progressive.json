{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:310370", "DISEASE": "Myoclonic Epilepsy, Progressive", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Myoclonic Epilepsy, Progressive present clinical features that include epileptic seizures, cognitive impairment, and movement disorders. The clinical features of this disease are not specific and overlap with other genetic epilepsies.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha-subunit of the neuronal voltage-g. Some special cases also present a mutation in the SCN2A gene.\n\nThe disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an autosome (chromosome 1 is an autosome), and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disease.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. The SCN1A gene encodes the alpha-subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Na1.1. The Na1.1 channel is responsible for the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons.\n. The main symptomatic differences of Myoclonic Epilepsy, Progressive from similar diseases is that the disease is progressive and the onset is in childhood.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene.
