{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:614706", "DISEASE": "Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 11", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 11 present clinical features that include epilepsy, progressive dementia, ataxia, and movement disorders. The main clinical features of CLN11 are: early-onset epilepsy, progressive cognitive decline, ataxia, and dystonia. CLN11 is caused by mutations in the CLN11 gene, which encodes the lysosomal. Some special cases also present with cataracts, hypogonadism, and diabetes mellitus. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin in the lysosomes of neurons and glial cells. CLN11 is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). The TPP1 enzyme is involved in the degradation of the sphingolipid ceramide. The accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in the lysosomes of neurons and glial cells leads to neuronal cell death.. The main symptomatic differences of Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 11 from similar diseases is that CLN11 patients present with early-onset epilepsy, progressive cognitive decline, ataxia, and dystonia.\n\nThe CLN11 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21.1). The CLN11 gene contains 10 exons and is expressed in the brain,", "SUMMARY": " spinal cord, and retina. The CLN11 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). TPP1 is involved in the degradation of the sphingolipid ceramide. The"}
