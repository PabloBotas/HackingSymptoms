{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:613722", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 12", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 12 present clinical features that include epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorders.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 12 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called the alpha-1A subunit of the L. Some special cases also present with a severe form of epilepsy called infantile spasms.\n\nThe alpha-1A subunit of the L is found in the membranes of neurons, which are cells that transmit information in the brain. The alpha-1A subunit of the L is thought to play a role in the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay messages between neurons.\n\nThe L is a protein complex that is involved in the generation and propagation of electrical signals in the brain. The L is composed of four different subunits, including the alpha-1A subunit.\n\nThe L is located in the membranes of neurons. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 12 from similar diseases is that patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 12 have seizures that are not well controlled with anti-epileptic drugs.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 12 is a rare genetic disorder. The disease is caused by mutations in the CACNA", "SUMMARY": "1A gene. The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called the alpha-1A subunit of the L.\n\nThe alpha-1A subunit of the L is found in the membranes of neurons, which"}
