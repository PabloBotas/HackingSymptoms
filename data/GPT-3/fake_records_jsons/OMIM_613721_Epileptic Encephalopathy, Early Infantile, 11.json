{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:613721", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 11", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 11 present clinical features that include seizures, cognitive impairment, and movement disorders. In addition, patients with this disorder have a wide range of clinical severity, with some patients having a normal life expectancy and others with a very poor prognosis.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the EPM2A gene, which encodes the protein lys. Some special cases also present mutations in the EPM2B gene, which encodes the protein lys. The mutations in the EPM2A gene are located in the C-terminal region of the protein, which is involved in the regulation of the lysosomal degradation of proteins. The mutations in the EPM2B gene are located in the N-terminal region of the protein, which is involved in the regulation of the lysosomal degradation of proteins.\n\nThe lysosomal degradation of proteins is a process that is essential for the maintenance of the cellular homeostasis. This process is carried out by lysos. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 11 from similar diseases is that the mutations in the EPM2A gene cause a more severe phenotype than the mutations in the EPM2B gene.\n\nThe diagnosis of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 11 is based on clinical findings and the identification of mutations in the EPM2A gene or the E", "SUMMARY": "PM2B gene. The identification of mutations in the EPM2A gene is done by DNA sequencing. The identification of mutations in the EPM2B gene is done by DNA sequencing and DNA analysis.\n\nThe treatment of Epileptic"}
