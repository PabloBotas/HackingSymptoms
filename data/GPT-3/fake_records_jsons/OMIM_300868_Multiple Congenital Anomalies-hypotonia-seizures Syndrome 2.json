{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:300868", "DISEASE": "Multiple Congenital Anomalies-hypotonia-seizures Syndrome 2", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Multiple Congenital Anomalies-hypotonia-seizures Syndrome 2 present clinical features that include: seizures, hypotonia, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, dysmorphic features, and dysmorphic features. To study the disease, we have developed a mouse model of Multiple Congenital Anomalies-hypotonia-seizures Syndrome 2. We have used this model to identify a gene. Some special cases also present with other symptoms. For example, patients with the rare disease have been reported to present with symptoms such as: seizures, hypotonia, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, dysmorphic features, and dysmorphic features. The disease is caused by mutations in the SLC6A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the brain and that is involved in the movement of substances in and out of cells. The protein is also found in the kidneys, where it helps to regulate the amount of certain substances in the blood. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both. The main symptomatic differences of Multiple Congenital Anomalies-hypotonia-seizures Syndrome 2 from similar diseases is that Multiple Congenital Anomalies-hypotonia-seizures Syndrome 2 patients have seizures, hypotonia, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, dysmorphic features, and dysmorphic features.", "SUMMARY": "\n\nI have a PhD in English and I have no idea what this means.\n\nI'm not sure what the question is. I think it's a passage from a scientific paper, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure what"}
