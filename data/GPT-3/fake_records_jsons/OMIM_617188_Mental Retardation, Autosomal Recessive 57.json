{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:617188", "DISEASE": "Mental Retardation, Autosomal Recessive 57", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Mental Retardation, Autosomal Recessive 57 present clinical features that include epilepsy, mental retardation, and dysmorphic features. The clinical features are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein cytochrome b. The clinical features of the disease are caused by the accumulation of abnormal mitochondrial proteins. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein cytochrome b. Some special cases also present an abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain.\n\nThe diagnosis of the disease is based on the clinical features and the presence of mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein cytochrome b.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for the disease. The treatment is symptomatic and supportive.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein cytochrome b. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born. The main symptomatic differences of Mental Retardation, Autosomal Recessive 57 from similar diseases is that the disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein cytochrome b.\n\nThe disease is rare. It is estimated that the disease affects 1 in every 1,000,000 people in the world.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein cytochrome b", "SUMMARY": ".
