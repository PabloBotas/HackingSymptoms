{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:610127", "DISEASE": "Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 10", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 10 present clinical features that include visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and seizures. These patients are at risk of developing epilepsy and are at risk of developing cognitive impairment and behavioral problems.\n\nThis is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000. It is a fatal disease with a life expectancy of approximately 15 years.\n\nThe main. Some special cases also present with cognitive impairment, such as Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Juvenile, 2 (CLJ2) and CLN3.\n\nCeroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 10 (CLN10) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the CLN10 gene. CLN10 is a member of the CLN family of genes, which encode proteins that are involved in the degradation of cellular waste products.\n\nThe CLN10 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q21.1).\n\nCLN10 is caused by mutations in. The main symptomatic differences of Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 10 from similar diseases is that CLN10 patients present with a later onset of seizures and a later onset of visual impairment.\n\nCeroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 10 is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000.
