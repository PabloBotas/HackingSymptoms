{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:300672", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 2", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 2 present clinical features that include epilepsy, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and motor impairment. The diagnosis of this disease is based on the clinical presentation and on the identification of a mutation in the EIEE2 gene.\n\nThe EIEE2 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the elongin B family of proteins. This. Some special cases also present a distinct phenotype.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 2 is a rare disease. It is estimated that the prevalence of this disease is less than 1 in , people in the United States.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the EIEE2 gene. The EIEE2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1. The EIEE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the elongin B family of proteins.\n\nThe protein is found in the nucleus of cells. The protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression.\n\n. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 2 from similar diseases is that it presents a more severe phenotype.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the EIEE2 gene. The EIEE2 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1. The EIEE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the elongin B family of proteins.", "SUMMARY": "\n\nThe protein is found in the nucleus of cells.
