{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:613863", "DISEASE": "Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 7", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 7 present clinical features that include epilepsy, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems.\n\nEpilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that cause changes in behavior, sensations, and/or involuntary movements. The severity of seizures ranges from brief and nearly undetectable to life. Some special cases also present with fever.\n\nGeneralized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 7 is caused by mutations in the GABRG2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called GABA-A receptor, which is found in the brain. The GABA-A receptor is a protein that regulates the flow of the chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) GABA in the brain. GABA is a chemical that is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses between brain cells. GABA-A receptor is a protein that regulates the flow of the chemical messenger GABA in the brain. GABA is a chemical that is involved in the transmission. The main symptomatic differences of Generalized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 7 from similar diseases is that the patients present with a higher incidence of seizures and behavioral problems.\n\nGeneralized Epilepsy With Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 7 is a rare disease. It is estimated that only about one in every one million people in the United States has this disease.\n\nGeneralized Epilepsy With", "SUMMARY": " Febrile Seizures Plus, Type 7 is caused by mutations in the GABRG2 gene.
