{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:614959", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 14", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 14 present clinical features that include epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and behavioral problems. In addition, patients with this disease may have a wide range of clinical manifestations, including mental retardation, autism, and/or cerebral palsy.\n\nThe diagnosis of this disease is based on clinical features, and is confirmed by genetic testing.\n\nThe. Some special cases also present with cardiac abnormalities, such as ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called Cav1.1, which is a voltage-gated calcium channel. This protein is found in the membranes of brain cells. It helps to control the flow of calcium ions into brain cells. Calcium ions are important for the normal function of brain cells.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 14 is inherited in an autosomal. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 14 from similar diseases is that it is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene.\n\nThe diagnosis of this disease is based on clinical features, and is confirmed by genetic testing.\n\nThe. Some special cases also present with cardiac abnormalities, such as ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and", "SUMMARY": " atrial septal defect.\n\nThe disease is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene.
