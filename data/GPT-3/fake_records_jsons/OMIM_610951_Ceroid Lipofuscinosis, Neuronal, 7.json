{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:610951", "DISEASE": "Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 7", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 7 present clinical features that include visual impairment, seizures, and behavioral problems.\n\nAims: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and genetic features of a large cohort of patients with CLN7 disease.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with CLN7 disease seen at the National Institutes of Health (. Some special cases also present in the literature were included.\n\nResults: A total of 48 patients were included in the study. The mean age at onset was 3.5 years (range, 0.3-15 years). The most common clinical features were visual impairment (100%), seizures (96%), and behavioral problems (96%). The most common EEG findings were epileptiform discharges (82%) and focal slowing (78%). The most common MRI findings were white matter hyperintensities (96%) and atrophy (96%). The most common CSF findings were elevated protein (96%) and normal glucose (96%). The most common neuropsychological findings. The main symptomatic differences of Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 7 from similar diseases is that patients with CLN7 disease have a higher frequency of seizures, behavioral problems, and EEG abnormalities.\n\nConclusions: CLN7 disease is a rare, severe, and complex disease. The most common clinical features are visual impairment, seizures, and behavioral problems. The most common EEG findings are epileptiform dis", "SUMMARY": "charges and focal slowing.
