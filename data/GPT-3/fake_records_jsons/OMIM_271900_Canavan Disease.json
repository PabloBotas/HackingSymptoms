{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:271900", "DISEASE": "Canavan Disease", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Canavan Disease present clinical features that include mental retardation, epilepsy, and ataxia. This study aims to evaluate the clinical and genetic characteristics of Canavan Disease patients in the North of Portugal. The study included 30 patients with Canavan Disease, of which 23 were homozygous for the mutation (A to G) at nucleotide 677 of the. Some special cases also present other mutations in thegene. The results show that the most frequent age of onset is between 2 and 3 years, and the most frequent clinical presentation is the presence of epilepsy. The most frequent seizure type is the generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The most frequent EEG finding is the presence of hypsarrhythmia. The most frequent EEG finding is the presence of hypsarrhythmia. The most frequent EEG finding is the presence of hypsarrhythmia. The most frequent EEG finding is the presence of hypsarrhythmia. The most frequent EEG finding is the presence of hypsarrh. The main symptomatic differences of Canavan Disease from similar diseases is that the patients with Canavan Disease present ataxia, while patients with Mucolipidosis type II do not present ataxia.", "SUMMARY": " The most frequent age of onset is between 2 and 3 years, and the most frequent clinical presentation is the presence of epilepsy.
