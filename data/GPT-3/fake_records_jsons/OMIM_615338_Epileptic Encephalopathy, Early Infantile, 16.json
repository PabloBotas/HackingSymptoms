{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:615338", "DISEASE": "Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 16", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 16 present clinical features that include epileptic seizures, cognitive impairment, and motor impairment. The epileptic seizures are often refractory to treatment, and patients are often dependent on life-long antiepileptic drug therapy. Cognitive impairment is present in all patients, and motor impairment is present in the majority of patients. The cognitive impairment is characterized. Some special cases also present with congenital malformations, such as cardiac defects, and some patients have additional neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder.\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 16 is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1. The channel is expressed in the brain, and mutations in the gene lead to a reduction in the number of functional channels. The reduction in the number of functional channels leads to hyperexcitability of the neurons in the brain. The hyperexcitability of the neurons leads to epileptic seizures.\n\n. The main symptomatic differences of Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 16 from similar diseases is that Epileptic Encephalopathy, Early Infantile, 16 is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1. The channel is expressed in the brain, and mutations in the gene lead to a reduction in the number of functional channels. The reduction in", "SUMMARY": " the number of functional channels leads to hyperexcitability of the neurons in the brain. The hyperexcitability of the neurons leads to epileptic seizures.\n\n.
