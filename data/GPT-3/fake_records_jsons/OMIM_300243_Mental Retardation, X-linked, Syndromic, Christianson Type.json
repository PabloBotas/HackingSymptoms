{"OMIM ID": "OMIM:300243", "DISEASE": "Mental Retardation, X-linked, Syndromic, Christianson Type", "RECORD": "Rare disease patients have complex clinical representations. Patients with Mental Retardation, X-linked, Syndromic, Christianson Type present clinical features that include mental retardation, epilepsy, and dysmorphic features.\n\nMental Retardation, X-linked, Syndromic, Christianson Type is caused by mutations in the MRE11A gene. The MRE11A gene provides instructions for making a protein called MRE11A. This protein is. Some special cases also present with skeletal abnormalities.\n\nMRE11A is a member of the MRE11 family of proteins. The MRE11 family of proteins plays a role in DNA repair. The MRE11A protein is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA.\n\nMRE11A is also involved in the repair of DNA crosslinks. DNA crosslinks are formed when two strands of DNA become linked together. DNA crosslinks can occur within the DNA of chromosomes or between chromosomes.\n\nMRE11A is also involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks that occur within the DNA of mitochondria. The main symptomatic differences of Mental Retardation, X-linked, Syndromic, Christianson Type from similar diseases is that the symptoms are more severe.\n\nMRE11A is also involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks that occur within the DNA of mitochondria.
